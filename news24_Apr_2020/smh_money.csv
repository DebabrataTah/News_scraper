They’re bending over backwards to help customers during the coronavirus crisis. For businesses, they’re extending discounted loans, fee waivers and expedited processing. For residential mortgage holders, they’re giving up-to six-month repayment holidays. Taking a payment holiday on your home loan will cost you more in the long run.Credit:Louie Douvis However, just remember that for all of the above, for the banks it will mean short-term pain for longer-term gain. It's the opposite for borrowers, who mostly will pay more. According to RateCity, a half-year mortgage holiday towards the beginning of an average $400,000 loan at 3.54 per cent will end up costing you an extra $6000 – even if you lift your repayments afterwards, so that your loan term stays the same. That would require an extra $62 a month. And if you instead keep your payments at their original level, the loan will blow out by more than $17,000 – and 15 months! However, there are three smarter, cheaper ways than cutting your mortgage payments. Money asked loan comparison website Mozo to identify the most competitive deals with offset accounts (we disregarded home loans without real offset accounts, which are a really powerful debt-reduction tool, so looked at mortgages from authorised deposit-taking institutions only). Many borrowers are learning the hard way – as banks refuse to extend repayment holidays to people who have accelerated repayments directly into their mortgages – that paying extra into a companion, quarantined offset account is a smarter and safer move. In the global coronavirus crack-up, US financial institutions have even stopped borrowers accessing these savings, when it was assumed they could always be easily redrawn. The average variable rate for an owner occupier making principal and interest mortgage repayments is now 3.43 percent. But the best-value mortgages – the cheapest with real offset accounts – start at 2.55 per cent (HSBC, MOVE Bank, G&C Mutual Bank and Easy Street round out the top four). A move from the average advertised Big 4 package rate, at 4.51 per cent, would save $421 a month. However, you might not even have to move banks. Our largest institutions are disclosing a discount of some 0.7 per cent, and will be giving far more on the sly. Even the disclosed discount would save almost $200 a month without having to move… and you could angle for more, based on the fact you know you could be paying as little as 2.55 per cent. Interest-only mortgages have long been on the nose with Australia’s financial regulators, as they sought to deflate an overheated – and over-leveraged – property market. As such, hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders have been switched to principal and interest in recent years, to ensure they chip away at their debt. Going interest-only can as much as half your repayment overnight. It also saves you from expensively paying interest on interest, as you would if you took a total mortgage holiday. You can return to paying principal, well, just as soon as you can. My three rules for fixing a home loan interest rate are: Only ever fix half of the loan, only for a maximum of three years and only if you can get an immediate discount on your payments… and today you can. While variable rates are down 24 basis points since the start of March, the typical one-year fix has been slashed 52 points. Mozo says there are fixes of 2.09 per cent available over one, two and three years (lenders include Well Home Loans, Reduce Home Loans and ING). Just be aware that when you fix, you often can’t pay extra off the home loan, to save interest and slash your loan term. Fixed rates usually come with a substandard offset account, too.

As of mid-week, some 456,000 applications, with a value of $3.8 billion, have been made via MyGov, approved by the ATO, and on-sent to the super funds for payment. The average request is for around $8,000. The government has not taken the decision lightly to allow early release of super. But for Australians whose finances have been significantly affected by COVID-19, accessing a limited amount of super today may outweigh the benefits of locking up savings all the way to retirement. In conjunction with other measures the government has announced, such as the doubling of Jobseeker and the $130 billion Jobkeeper package, this is the largest economic lifeline in Australia’s history. Of course, early withdrawal of super is a trade-off. Some people have no choice when it comes to accessing their super early.Credit:Jason South Money withdrawn now won’t gather compound interest for retirement unless replaced down the track. But money taken out of super need not be a permanent withdrawal. We’d all want to avoid borrowing long term on a credit card, and seek to repay that as soon as the household budget permits. And when it comes to super, the government already has flexible measures in place for members to re-contribute to super when times are better, such as the option of catch-up contributions. But for those who need money now, there may be no easy options. It’s important to look at the counterfactual: the alternative might be incurring costly personal loans, credit card debt or selling the family car. If members have made the difficult decision to draw on their own savings, they will expect their super fund to release their money as quickly as possible. At a time when money is tight and there are pressing needs for families, everyone must play their part – including super funds. For our part, the government has ensured the administration is as simple as possible. Applications for early release must be made through MyGov (my.gov.au); an individual does not need to contact their super fund to make a claim. The ATO shoulders the burden of verification and assessment. So the government’s ask of the $3 trillion super industry is simple: respond to the ATO’s requests and release funds to members as quickly as possible, within five business days. That’s the benchmark set by APRA, the superannuation sector regulator. This is an opportunity for all super funds to demonstrate their commitment to their members at a time when they need it most. I’m glad to see that many funds have responded to the call, worked diligently on their systems and capacity and are standing ready to help. A number have told me that they aim not just to meet but to beat that five-day benchmark. And for any who speculate on strains in the super system, let me put this ask in context. Treasury estimates that fewer than 1.7 million Australians will apply for early release, equating to around $27 billion. This is less than one per cent of the circa $3 trillion in super funds. It’s also less than a quarter of the total that workers contributed to super last financial year. No sector of the economy is immune to COVID-19. Members will be looking to super funds to pull their weight, just like the rest of us. And others will be looking too. Any fund refusing prompt access to a member’s money after ATO approval can expect to be the focus of attention from their members, from the media and from the regulators. APRA has made its expectations clear. For those who can’t – or won’t – meet them, APRA’s new directions powers give it teeth that may well be tested.

Unfortunately, some of their offers come in a poisoned chalice. You pay a massive price for ""enjoying"" minimum monthly home-loan repayments.Credit:iStock Offers to defer mortgage payments for six months, or three months for credit-card payments, while interest and fees continue, results in lenders collecting interest on interest. Don’t fall for it – unless you have no alternative. And if you are making extra mortgage repayments, continue doing it and save tens of thousands in interest. Because of the way that compound interest works, there is little interest to be saved by making extra mortgage repayments once the term of a loan is less than 10 years. According to my loan calculators, at an interest rate of 3 per cent, a 10-year term is achieved once you can repay $970 a month for each $100,000 borrowed. For example, on the average loan of $400,000 that is a monthly payment of $3880. At the other end of the spectrum are loans written on a 30-year term. That would be $422 a month for every $100,000 borrowed. The difference in interest between these two loans is staggering. For the 10-year loan, total interest is about $63,000. For the 30-year loan, the total interest would be $207,000. Remember that home loan interest is non-tax-deductible. This means, if you are a mid-tier taxpayer, the interest on that 30-year loan would take $340,000 of your pre-tax salary. That’s a massive price to pay for “enjoying” minimum monthly home loan repayments. I have been writing about this for years and urging borrowers to get ahead in their mortgage repayments, not only to provide a safety buffer if interest rates rise or they suffer financial stress, but also to save a fortune in interest. A realistic goal is a 20-year term, which requires payments of $560 for each $100,000 borrowed – $2240 a month on a $400,000 loan. That’s only about $127 a week extra but it will cut the interest bill to $130,000. Given the undeniable benefits to borrowers of increasing their mortgage payments, I was horrified when a Commonwealth Bank (CBA) client sent me an email they had received which read: “We’re taking steps to continue providing the financial support our customers need. This is why we are making a one-off change to your home loan direct-debit repayment amount, reducing it to the current minimum required payment.” The bank then clarified that there is an “opt-out” procedure, that is, borrowers who want to continue with higher home loan repayments must go out of their way to tell the bank. Any marketing consultant will tell you that setting an “opt out” option is a major tool in getting people to make a change you would like them to. Think about it: most of us suffer from a barrage of paperwork, seldom read the fine print, and even the thought of having to go to somebody’s website and do all the hard work to “opt out” is enough to make us shudder. It is hardly likely to happen. It is therefore irresponsible of CBA to make the automatic ""opt in"" provision, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that it is just a sneaky way for it to boost its profits at a time when banks, in general, are doing it tough. The bank could just as easily have written to their customers along the lines of, “We appreciate these are tough times, but urge you to continue making your extra payments at the current level to pay off your loan as fast as possible and continue saving interest. However, if you need to reduce your payments, please contact us.” It would make that option available to those who need it. By making the proceedure a default “opt in” for lower payments, many more homeowners will cease making higher payments that are in their own best interests. The chances are high that CBA customers will ignore their email, let the bank reduce their repayments and extend the term of the mortgage by years, resulting in borrowers paying thousands of dollars of unnecessary interest.

Rather than wait an average eight years to save a 20 per cent deposit on a median-priced property, a third of homebuyers cop the hefty cost of Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) on the chin. Many borrowers mistakenly believe LMI is designed to protect them if they default on the loan.Credit:  Many borrowers mistakenly believe LMI is designed to protect them if they default on a loan, enabling them to keep their home. However, it protects only the lender if the borrower defaults. More than $844 million in new LMI policies were written by mortgage insurers last year. Now, as a growing number of homeowners scramble to read the fine print on their policies amid the economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, they are realising they are not protected. Without a 20 per cent deposit, homebuyers are usually required to take out LMI. Self-employed buyers and non-residents may also need a policy, with lenders deciding on a case-by-case basis. LMI was introduced by the federal government in 1965 to transfer the risk from lenders to insurers. It is not cheap, either. If you save a 5 per cent deposit for a $500,000 loan, you will need to pay an eye-watering $15,960 in LMI premiums. Not a cent of this covers the buyer. LMI is usually arranged by the lender during the loan approval process. The cost is agreed between the lender and the insurer, and the premium paid by the homebuyer as a one-off fee. It can be paid as a lump sum, although lenders often add the premium to the home loan amount, so it can paid it off over time, which means borrowers pay interest on the insured amount. Eligible first-home buyers can save about $10,000 in LMI costs with just a 5 per cent deposit under the government’s new First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. Another 10,000 scheme places will be available from July this year. Consumer advocate Choice called on the banking royal commission to abolish LMI, expressing concerns about a lack of choice between products and that they offered no value to consumers. “Evidence of premiums at one insurer almost five times higher than at a competitor may be indicative of extreme profiteering,” the Choice submission read. The Banking Code of Practice stopped short of abolishing the policies, but halted LMI commissions. Many first-time homebuyers do not look past interest rates when calculating how much they will pay for a new loan, overlooking LMI, Sydney mortgage broker Otto Dargan says. However, homebuyers should bear in mind that the rate that LMI is charged jumps significantly at certain borrowing thresholds. “If you’re borrowing $299,999, you will pay much less in LMI than if you borrow $300,001, even though your loan is just $2 more,” he says. The cost of LMI jumps again when you borrow more than 90 per cent of the property's value. So, a relatively small reduction in the size of your loan can result in significant savings, he says. Dargan recommends that homebuyers obtain an estimate of the LMI premium they would pay with a range of lenders and insurers. “The problem is that banks and lenders don’t actively publish the LMI premium rates of their mortgage insurer, so it’s difficult to compare,” Dargan says. However, mortgage brokers have access to this information and should compare the cost of LMI when making a recommendation, he says. Copyright © 2020", Nina Hendy ,"April 21, 2020"

8,/money/super-and-retirement/why-you-should-resist-the-urge-to-switch-or-redeem-super-20200417-p54kwe.html,Why you should resist the urge to switch or redeem super,"This is the superannuation industry's week of reckoning. Anyone who has lost work as a result of the coronavirus crisis is now able to withdraw $10,000 from their retirement savings. In June, the same cohort will be able to take out another $10,000. Switching to cash or drawing down early on your super means funds may have to sell some liquid assets, such as shares, to meet demand.Credit:AAP It is a self-approval system, so all you need to do is go to the Australian Taxation Office website, via your myGov account, sign an online declaration to say you have lost at least 20 per cent of your income and your super fund is then required to pay out your money within five business days. Best case scenario: The mammoth government stimulus package means only a small portion of Australians – those genuinely struggling to stay afloat – will take advantage of the scheme. Worst case scenario: Super funds freeze redemptions and their cash reserves dry up, meaning the sector cannot recapitalise the economy on the other side of the crisis and the balances of members who don’t access the scheme take a beating. The industry has done everything it can to get the message out: Only tap into your super as a last resort. Losses will be crystallised if super is withdrawn at the bottom of the market and the younger you are, compounding returns mean the greater the long-term damage to your retirement savings. So, how does calculating the value of you super balance actually work? To understand why your balance goes up and down, you have to grasp unit pricing. When you invest in super, you are actually buying units in an investment portfolio that change daily in value, based on market forces and value audits.

Median growth funds fell by 12.5 per cent in March, according to research released this month by SuperRatings. That caused many panicked investors to jump ship to more defensive super options. When a member switches from an equities-heavy growth fund to a more defensive option, or cash, the fund erodes its cash buffer which, in turn, increases non-cash allocations of the portfolio, such as unlisted assets, including infrastructure and property. A report released this month by Deutsche Bank said that at face value the super system seems cashed up, with deposits accounting for 10 per cent of total assets amounting to $240 billion. However, most of that cash is invested in Self-Managed Super Funds and the institutional sector has just 5 per cent of its assets in cash, amounting to about $80 billion. ""That wouldn't normally matter much, but the present situation is unique as policy changes to allow early access to super have coincided with a market sell-off,"" DB researcher Tim Baker wrote. ""It doesn't seem unreasonable to suggest that as many as a million people might consider drawing down [their super], which would mean a drain of $20 billion from the super system. That's one-quarter of the deposits on hand. ""This could impede super funds' ability to seek out opportunities in the midst of this market sell-off.

Anyone who has lost work as a result of the coronavirus crisis is now able to withdraw $10,000 from their retirement savings. In June, the same cohort will be able to take out another $10,000. Switching to cash or drawing down early on your super means funds may have to sell some liquid assets, such as shares, to meet demand.Credit:AAP It is a self-approval system, so all you need to do is go to the Australian Taxation Office website, via your myGov account, sign an online declaration to say you have lost at least 20 per cent of your income and your super fund is then required to pay out your money within five business days. Best case scenario: The mammoth government stimulus package means only a small portion of Australians – those genuinely struggling to stay afloat – will take advantage of the scheme. Worst case scenario: Super funds freeze redemptions and their cash reserves dry up, meaning the sector cannot recapitalise the economy on the other side of the crisis and the balances of members who don’t access the scheme take a beating.

10,/money/super-and-retirement/cashing-in-an-investment-property-to-make-super-contributions-20200420-p54ld5.html,Cashing in an investment property to make super contributions,"Our house was purchased in my name in 1991 for $116,000. We lived in it as our family home until June, 2012, when we rented it out. It was then valued at $650,000. It was rented until August, 2019, and has been on the market for $785,000 since then. If we sell it before June of this year am I able to make a downsizer superannuation contribution of $300,000? I am not sure whether the 10-year rule applies because of the time rented. As I will also need to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on the profit from 2012 to the sale date, am I able to make total concessional contributions of $50,000 (2 x $25,000) using the bring-forward rule, to reduce my taxable income? I have $65,000 in super now. I turned 65 last month. Would I need to pass the work test for the concessional contributions? I have had conflicting responses from my super fund and the Australian Taxation Office. You are over 65, the property has been held for at least 10 years, and is partially CGT exempt. Illustration: Simon Letch Credit:  Therefore, you would appear to be eligible to make a downsizing contribution of $300,000, provided the contribution is made within 90 days of settlement of the property sale. CGT tax will be levied on the net increase in value from when it was rented, which may be about $140,000 after all expenses. After application of the 50 per cent discount, CGT will be levied by adding $70,000 to your taxable income in the year the sales contract was signed. As your superannuation balance was less than $500,000 at June 30 last year, you can use the bring-forward rule and contribute two lots of $25,000 as tax-deductible concessional contributions – provided you can pass the work test. Just make sure you liaise closely your with an accountant and your financial advisor to get the paperwork right. No work test is required for the downsizer contribution. My friends and I are mostly retired and living off our superannuation. We are talking about the possibility of moving our super back into accumulation mode, where it is not counted for Centrelink purposes, and applying for Newstart. With our super balances decreasing quickly, it would be worth it – even if it meant we would have to apply for some jobs. Possible? That’s certainly a possibility, as long as you have not yet reached pensionable age and can satisfy the Newstart eligibility criteria. Just bear in mind that your super is not actually “decreasing quickly” – it is fluctuating in line with the market. This means some days it will be up and some days it will be down. My wife and I are retired and the vast majority of our income is generated by our Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF), which has been in existence for about 20 years. Recently, we contemplated selling our existing home and buying another, and putting an extra $300,000 towards the purchase price. We figured that with interest rates so low, it would be a good idea to borrow the additional funds, rather that sell personal or super fund investments. After discussion with my bank, ANZ, I was staggered to discover it will not take into account ANY income generated by a SMSF. I suggested to the lending manager that if she were to lose her job, she may have difficulty in meeting housing loan repayments, whilst my wife and I did not have a job and will continue to draw the minimum legally required sum from our fund. I contacted Bank of Melbourne, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac, who all assured that SMSF income would be included in their assessment of any borrowing requirement that I may have. I think you should point out to your readers that if they receive the majority of their income from a SMSF, then they should not be banking with ANZ, as there may come a time when borrowing is a necessity, and the bank will turn them down. An ANZ spokesman confirmed that the bank has a long-standing policy of not accepting SMSF income for home loan applications through their retail arm. The bank is reviewing this policy, however, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely delay the outcome of the review. In what appears to be an anomaly, the spokesman tells me that ANZ's Private Bank can accept income from SMSFs for home loan applications, however, there are still a number of checks and balances and each application is assessed on its merits. Your question highlights the fact that lenders may have very different criteria. This is why a rejection by one is not necessarily the end of the road. Don’t be frightened to shop around. I just read your latest column and you mentioned the potential of a death tax. Could you please explain how this works. There is a death tax of 15 per cent, plus Medicare levy, which applies to the taxable component of your superannuation that is left to any non-dependent in your Will. A spouse is always regarded as a dependent. I have written often about ways to mitigate it.

11,/money/super-and-retirement/how-to-minimise-capital-gains-tax-on-an-investment-property-20200417-p54krr.html,How to minimise capital gains tax on an investment property,"I am 74 years old and retired. I am on a Commonwealth super pension of $1450 a fortnight and a Telstra super pension of $1750 twice a month. I own my own home, which is valued at $1 million. I also have an investment property which I acquired in 2007 at a cost of $400,000. I am thinking of selling both properties and moving to Sydney to buy a property there. I know when I sell my home I don’t have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT). The question I have is, if I sell my investment property for, say, $1 million, what are my options to reduce the CGT on the investment? Is my following assumption for the calculation of CGT correct? $1 million (selling price) – original cost $400,000 = $600,000 profit. Half of $600,000 is subject to CGT, which is $300,000. If my tax rate is 49 per cent, then my CGT is 0.49 x 300,000 = $147,000. Can you advise if there is any other option, for example, if I sell and put the money straight into another home in Sydney, can I reduce the CGT? S.L. It is a question that is becoming increasingly common as people who bought a property before the boom are now selling at inflated prices, having forgotten that high capital gains means high CGT. The best way to reduce a capital gain is to ensure that you have packed every possible capital expense accumulated over the period of ownership into your cost base.Credit:Fairfax Media Unless you are carrying forward a capital loss from a previous investment, the best way to reduce a capital gain is to ensure that you have packed every possible capital expense accumulated over the period of ownership into your cost base, and have the receipts to prove them. Then, if you are not over 65 and retired, make sure your tax deductible concessional contributions are as close to $25,000 as possible. In your case, being over 65, you cannot make a super contribution without meeting the work test of 40 hours in 30 days (more difficult while staying at home these days), so that latter option is not available. You can give money away in tax-deductible gifts and donations, but that may defeat the original purpose of your investment, or you can see if there are still any investments around, usually forestry or horticulturally based, that give you a 100 per cent deduction for your investment. The main problem with the latter is that you are often left with no asset and would have been better off paying 49 per cent tax that would, at least, have left you with 51 per cent of your money. Unless you are selling your properties as a result of a relationship breakdown, which may allow a deferral of CGT, then, no, you cannot claim a deduction, or defer the payment of tax, by buying yourself a new home.

12,/money/tax/bank-dividends-may-be-cut-but-their-shares-are-still-great-investments-20200413-p54jdx.html,Bank dividends may be cut but their shares are still great investments,"I read a newspaper article recently claiming it is possible that the big banks may cut out their dividends altogether. This would be catastrophic for us as we rely on them to live. Do you have any thoughts on this matter? This is a difficult area because some of our major banks recently agreed to a request from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand not to pay dividends in the near future. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  The reasoning is that banks need to retain profits, so they stay in a position of strength – no matter what happens as the COVID-19 virus takes its toll. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) initially said it had no plans to force the banks to suspend their dividends during the coronavirus economic crisis but admitted it was in talks with them to understand their financial capacity for payouts. However, last Tuesday, APRA appeared to backflip, with chairman Wayne Byres writing to the bank boards, calling for restraint in dividends, buybacks and cash bonuses for executives. While he did not explicitly tell boards of banks and insurers to freeze their dividend payments, he did say that if they do pay a dividend, it must first be cleared by the regulator – and any payments must be made at a level that is ""materially reduced."" We are living with uncertainty but I believe the worst that could happen is that dividends may be suspended for six months but then restored. If that happens, the renewed dividend may well be bigger than expected. I think our banks have a tough year ahead of them and bad debts will be on the increase. However, they have a lot of fat to fall back on and I am sure they will continue paying dividends in the medium to long term. The big question is how big those dividends will be. There seems to be an industry consensus that a 30 per cent reduction in dividends paid by the big-four banks would be possible but don’t forget the dividend yield on bank shares is currently about 10 per cent per annum, fully franked. If the dividend was cut to 7 per cent, fully franked, they would still be a great investment, especially in a climate where interest rates will be low for many years to come. At some stage we will get through all this and the stock market will surge again.   I am now working from home on full pay. I have had no increase in my costs because the internet and phone are all bundled. In fact, my expenses have dropped because I no longer have the costs of going to work. Can I claim anything on my tax return? I have converted one bedroom to a home office for exclusive office use. Julia Hartman, of BAN TACS Accountants, says it is possible and, if done properly, would not affect the Capital Gains Tax main residence exemption on your home. You must keep a diary record for at least one month showing the hours you spend working at home. The Australian Taxation Office has just introduced an 80 cents per hour rate for the period from March 1 to June 30, 2020. While it is higher than the old 52 cents per hour rate, it is not necessarily a bargain. If you choose the 80 cents per hour rate you cannot claim separately for depreciation on your computer, use of internet, stationery or home phone. They are all tied up in the 80 cents an hour. On the upside, you do not have to have a dedicated work area, so this means that each member of the household that is working from home can claim 80 cents an hour. For the period before the March 1 – or alternatively if it gives you a better claim – you can use the old 52 cents an hour to cover electricity and wear and tear on furniture and carpet but also be able to claim separately for internet, stationery, phone and your computer. You can claim for your home internet if you record the private verses business use for a month, but you need to record everyone’s use. This may be difficult if you have children. Your phone plan can be apportioned on the ratio of business to private use. As an adjunct to your diary, go through your next phone statement and highlight the work-related calls. If your statement is not itemized then use the recent call log and print screen to create a list of the calls you have made over the past month. You should keep receipts for everything, as there may be additional costs, such as stationery, couriers and postage, that are easily overlooked. If your home has now become your base of operations, you may find you have to use your car often on work-related visits. Make sure you record each trip in the diary. You should be able to claim 68 cents a kilometre. Enter the reason for the travel, the kilometres travelled and the destination.

More of us would be wary of stretching ourselves, saving more of our income, as well as taking on less debt and not spending as much as before the crisis.  That would add up to an even slower recovery. And China is not going to be quite the same economic engine for Australia's growth – at least in the short term – that it has been over the past 10 years.

Craig James, chief economist at Commsec, says if it does turn out to be only 1.2 per cent that would make it the slowest rate of growth since 1976 – the last year China's  ""cultural revolution"". The IMF is forecasting Australia's economy will contract by 6.7 per cent this year; though, encouragingly, it has pencilled in a growth rate of 6.1 per cent next year.

Research by the Reserve Bank of Australia and Allan Fels, a former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, shows banks charge new customers about $1000 less each year for a $250,000 home loan on average, and insurers 27 per cent less for a home insurance policy, compared to longer-serving customers.

Then demand a better deal.Credit:Dreamstime/TNS It is an open secret in the financial services industries that the squeaky wheel gets the good oil. New customers and those who demand a better deal usually get treated much better than those who are loyal and never complain. We have given this phenomenon a range of names over the years, including the ""loyalty tax"" or ""the lazy tax"". Behind closed doors, businesses sometime call new customers ""price-chasers"" (in the case of those who move around to chase cheaper deals) and ""sleeping beauties"" (those who peacefully doze away while paying top dollar, and must not be awoken!) Whole industries have been built on the back of this pricing model. However, it will keep happening because, frankly, not enough of us catch them out! The banking and insurance lobbies argue that this is ""competition in action"" and they are right. As consumers, we must take our share of the blame. Nobel Prize-winning economists and psychologists have shown in experiments that human beings exhibit ""status-quo bias"" and ""loss aversion"" – two tendencies that make us more likely to stick with inferior options, even when they are against our best interests. This has a range of consequences, from making us less likely to change the channel once we are watching the 6pm news, to making us more likely to remain with the super fund our employer recommends, even if it is a dud. It helps make us pay more than we should for insurance and home loans, too. Businesses know the power of the ""status-quo bias"" and use it to make money for their shareholders. However, we can also use it to save money for ourselves. Here’s how. ""Mystery shoppers"" are people who are paid by a business to effectively spy on their employees. For example, they might wander into a shop and try on some clothing, or eat at a restaurant, and then write a report for the boss on the level of customer service. But we can also ""mystery shop"" our insurance and banking providers now, thanks to the power of the internet. This is a savings strategy we can do without setting foot outside in the COVID-19 era. Most insurance companies have online quoting tools, making it harder to hide what they are charging other customers. Banks, too, have been forced to be more transparent in their mortgage pricing, mainly because of the growth of online comparison websites. So go ahead: ""mystery shop"" them. First, go to your car or home insurer’s website and get a quote using the same details as your current policy. Like any good ""mystery shopper"", you might need to don a disguise, as they will probably have your details saved. You could use your neighbour’s address, for instance. You should also check out your lender’s website to see what they are advertising to new customers. Then see how that compares to comparison sites, such as RateCity, Canstar or Finder. If it turns out they are treating you like a ""sleeping beauty"", give them a call or send them an email and tell them you just woke up! Ask them why they are charging you more, tell them the other prices you have been quoted, and say you want a lower price. They should be prepared to play ball.

This has a range of consequences, from making us less likely to change the channel once we are watching the 6pm news, to making us more likely to remain with the super fund our employer recommends, even if it is a dud. It helps make us pay more than we should for insurance and home loans, too. Businesses know the power of the ""status-quo bias"" and use it to make money for their shareholders. However, we can also use it to save money for ourselves. Here’s how. ""Mystery shoppers"" are people who are paid by a business to effectively spy on their employees. For example, they might wander into a shop and try on some clothing, or eat at a restaurant, and then write a report for the boss on the level of customer service. But we can also ""mystery shop"" our insurance and banking providers now, thanks to the power of the internet. This is a savings strategy we can do without setting foot outside in the COVID-19 era. Most insurance companies have online quoting tools, making it harder to hide what they are charging other customers. Banks, too, have been forced to be more transparent in their mortgage pricing, mainly because of the growth of online comparison websites. So go ahead: ""mystery shop"" them. First, go to your car or home insurer’s website and get a quote using the same details as your current policy. Like any good ""mystery shopper"", you might need to don a disguise, as they will probably have your details saved. You could use your neighbour’s address, for instance. You should also check out your lender’s website to see what they are advertising to new customers. Then see how that compares to comparison sites, such as RateCity, Canstar or Finder. If it turns out they are treating you like a ""sleeping beauty"", give them a call or send them an email and tell them you just woke up! Ask them why they are charging you more, tell them the other prices you have been quoted, and say you want a lower price. They should be prepared to play ball. After all, I was taught this trick by someone who used to run an insurance company! Joel Gibson is a columnist & the author of KILL BILLS!

17,/money/planning-and-budgeting/this-is-how-much-you-should-budget-for-food-each-week-20200416-p54kbj.html,This is how much you should budget for food each week,"One of the biggest questions when it comes to assembling a household budget is how much money to set aside for food. Food is, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the second-biggest category of household spending, after housing costs and before transport. The average food spend per Australian is $4740 per year, or $91 per week. So, I dedicated week five of my ""Money Makeover"" to one simple mission: figuring out how much I spend on food. Being a massive numbers nerd from way back, I decided to keep a five-day, detailed food journal and to calculate the cost of each meal. The idea was not to save money, but simply to become more aware of what I was already spending on food in a typical week. It went like this. On Monday morning, I hit the shops to buy a week's worth of groceries in my usual manner. Upon returning home, I created an Excel spreadsheet and listed every single item I had purchased by total weight, total price and price per unit. One dozen eggs at $9.99, for example, is 83 cents per egg. A loaf of bread containing 19 slices at $2.69 is 14 cents per slice. And so forth. I then committed to spending the next five days writing down – with pen and paper – every single thing I ate. Each night, I would calculate the exact cost of everything I consumed. My first major discovery was that eating at home – as we are all mostly doing now – is far cheaper than I imagined. On day one I consumed just $11.08 worth of food – roughly half of what I'd spend at a single cafe brunch. It looked like this: Breakfast: Two homemade coffees, plus two fried eggs on two pieces of toast. Total cost $2.92. Lunch: Minced beef, avocado and salad burrito. Total cost $3.10. Dinner: Eight ""Dino snacks"" (if you're a parent, you know. If not, essentially chicken nuggets) with frozen peas, carrot and corn, plus a dessert of fresh figs and peanut butter. Total cost also $3.10. Snacks: Fresh berries (on sale for $1 a punnet) plus carrots with hummus. Total cost $1.96. I also drank a 100ml glass of red wine ($1.67), but have decided to include spending on alcohol in a later ""lifestyle"" budgeting category – alcohol being lovely, sometimes, but not essential to sustain human life. Surprisingly, things didn't change much from there, with subsequent days coming in at $12.55, $12.76, $11.40 and $13.41. That's an average cost per day of $12.24. Calculating costs this way was quite tedious, at times, and involved weighing and recording each ingredient used to facilitate cross-checking later on with my per unit spreadsheet. But it got easier with time. And how else are you to know? For the less numbers-inclined, I think you could get a similar benefit from becoming aware of the cost of your food choices by keeping a diary for just a day or two. Somewhat on a roll myself, however, I also conducted a full inventory of my pantry, freezer and fridge, discovering – to my utter surprise – I had more than $500 worth of food already sitting there. To remind myself not to waste it, I got out a big, black texta and wrote the price paid for each item on the labels. Now, when I go to my freezer, I'm reminded I paid $7.76 for that 300 grams of chicken breast, so I'd better use it. This also really helped make it easier to calculate costs for my diary. So, how does my spending compare? It turns out I am pretty average when it comes to my food spending. According to an ABS survey of household spending, the average household spent $12,324 on food in 2015-16. That excludes alcohol, but includes spending on takeaway and meals out. The latest Census states an average of 2.6 people live in each household in Australia. Replay   That gives an average food spend per Australian of $4740 per year, or $91 per week and $13 per day (pretty close to my $12.24 a day). Of course, these are just averages. Some people need more food, some less. Some people will want to spend more on eating out. Others will need to economise more than I did on my grocery shopping. And that's fine too. But if you're trying to put together a weekly food budget for your household, a rough rule of thumb is to allocate about $100 a week per person in your household.

While the market, as measured by the All Ordinaries Accumulation index, which includes dividends, was down some 15 per cent in the full year to March 31, consumer staples stocks, such as supermarket chains Coles Group and Woolworths, have been standouts. Strong sales at supermarkets have helped boost the returns for shareholders of Woolworths and Coles.Credit:Facebook Both heavyweights have seen their shares rally steadily over much of the past year but gained additional recent momentum amid brisk trading in the wake of panic buying resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Coles shareholders enjoyed a total return of almost 28 per cent in the year to March 31, figures from CommSec show. That makes it the best performer from a list of the 10 stocks most widely held by small investors. Woolworths shareholders have seen a total return of almost 15 per cent. Dale Gillham, an analyst at Wealth Within, says Woolworths is proving to be a defensive stock in challenging times. ""At the end of this month, it will release sales figures and, if they are as good as expected, then this will be reflected in the share price,"" Mr Gillham says. However, strong dividends and total returns are coming to an end, analysts say. Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, says many companies are already announcing cuts or cancellations of their dividends as the coronavirus-induced economic crisis bites. With more announcements expected, investors cannot rely on dividends being paid as many firms focus on survival and longer-term sustainability, he says. Of the 10 most popular stocks held by small investors, Peter Warnes, head of equities research at Morningstar, particularly likes Wesfarmers. It has ""many spokes in its wheel and is well placed,"" he says. Wesfarmers, which owns brands such as Bunnings, Officeworks and Kmart, produced a total return over the past year of minus 5.4 per cent. That makes it the third best-performing popular stock for small investors and a credible performance in a falling market. Warnes says the company's sales are higher for items such as home office equipment and technology, as more people work from home as a result of the pandemic. Wealth Within's Gillham expects Wesfarmers to not only weather the coronavirus storm but to come through ""well placed for the long term"". Both Warnes and Gillham also like defensive telco play Telstra. Warnes says the Vodafone and TPG merger ""could take a while to bed down"", which could work to Telstra's advantage. Gillham says the telco ""may even prosper over the coming months and years"". The worst performer among the 10 most widely held stocks is gambling company Tabcorp Holdings. With most of consumer spending now concentrated on essentials and with sports betting all but eliminated because of the coronavirus, demand for the gaming services provided by the company is vastly reduced, contributing to a total return of just over minus 43 per cent.

Our federal, state and territory governments are going to have to make some big calls on how we can emerge from lockdowns without triggering a second wave of coronavirus infections. Before the pandemic, sharemarket investors were enjoying massive run-ups in prices. Bull markets don't die of exhaustion or old age. There is inevitably a trigger, such as mistakes by governments or central banks or, as is the case now, an economic crisis induced by governments rightly prioritising the health of their people above all else. Wall Street’s remarkable 11-year bull run came to an end last month as fears about the spread of the virus hit share prices. And, in the two years prior to reaching its high in February, our market rose more than 30 per cent. That was driven by record-low interest rates and also by investors attracted to the high and tax-advantaged dividends of our largest listed companies. With the official cash interest rate set to remain at 0.25 per cent for the foreseeable future, there is certainly an incentive for investors to continue to look outside of cash investments for higher yields. However,  more companies are expected to cut or delay the payment of dividends. Many are also raising debt and have given up on providing any guidance on their profits. The sharemarket's snap back is likely being fuelled in part by share price bargain hunters with a high tolerance for risk. Many are not long-term investors and will sell as soon as they realise a decent capital gain. However, with the jobless rate soaring and, even under a best-case scenario, expected to hit 10 per cent, can any long-term investor really be certain about the prospects for our sharemarket, given it is primed to fall on any bad news? There are also the prospects that superannuation funds may be forced to sell some of their shares, to help fund the $27 billion that Treasury expects will be withdrawn by fund members under the government's early release super scheme for those experiencing financial hardship. For long-term investors, perhaps the best approach is to dollar-cost average into the market – slow and steady – with strategy and appropriate diversification, rather than investing on a whim. This simply involves investing the same amount of money into shares regular intervals over a long period – whether market prices are up or down.

Auction clearance rates have fallen off a cliff as buyers and sellers abandon the market in droves. Auctions and open house inspections have ceased in both NSW and Victoria; though online and phone auctions and one-on-one private inspections are still permitted. Auction clearance rates have plunged to record lows as bans on live auctions push real estate agents to run online sales. McGrath auctioneer Troy Malcolm takes bids during a live online auction on Saturday.Credit:Peter Rae More than 45 per cent of properties due to go to auction last weekend were withdrawn from sale, with the preliminary auction clearance rate plunging to just 48 per cent. Property researcher CoreLogic figures show that the clearance rate for the previous weekend was just 37.3 per cent – the lowest recorded since it commenced auction reporting data in 2008. Analysts say clearance rates are a leading indicator of major changes in property prices. Martin North, founder of Digital Finance Analytics, says even if the coronavirus-induced economic downturn is relatively short-lived, there could be property price falls of between 15 and 25 per cent over the next two or three years. ""If there's a longer-term crunch where the unemployment consequences and the failure of businesses is longer, then I think it could be 20 to 30 per cent,"" Mr North says. If the global disruption is prolonged, then it could top 45 per cent. However, the major price falls would not be uniform across the country and house prices are expected to hold up better than apartment values. ""Generally, houses hold their value more, other than the top end of the market, which is more volatile, and will do better than units,"" Mr North says. ""There are too many new [units], a lack of investors and there's a problem with [building] defects."" Hayden Dimes and Felicity Emmett, economists at ANZ bank, say the shutting down of auctions and home opens has seen both both buyers and sellers evaporate. ""As buyers and sellers dry up, we think properties that do trade through this shut-down period will see price falls,"" they say. The economists are expecting major price falls to start showing up as early as this month. Even when social distancing measures are removed, they say it is unlikely prices will bounce back. ""Despite enormous fiscal support, unemployment is still expected to rise sharply through this period and is unlikely to fully recover for some years,"" the ANZ economists say. Replay   Households are likely to have less appetite for debt, which would likely result in a slow recovery for house prices, they say. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, says higher levels of unemployment would trigger debt-servicing problems, which is bad news for property prices. This comes against a backdrop of very high household debt. He expects demand for property would be depressed for some time after the economic shutdown measures are relaxed. ""Hopefully, the federal government’s wage subsidy program will keep the rise in unemployment to below 10 per cent,"" Dr Oliver says. ""This, combined with various income-support measures and bank mortgage payment holidays, may serve to keep forced property selling to a minimum and price declines modest at around 5 per cent,"" he says. However, a long and deep coronavirus-driven downturn in the economy would point to a deeper property price slump of 20 per cent, or more, over the next 12 months, he says. More homebuyers, particularly those who purchased recently, will find that they are in ""negative equity"", where they owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. However, for those who are able to hold onto their homes during the downturn, the losses in the value of their houses are on paper only. The banks’ mortgage deferrals mean most households with a home loan that see their incomes fall substantially will be able to get through the downturn without losing their home, says Trent Wiltshire, an economist at Domain. However, the banks ""will not let all customers defer loan repayments indefinitely"", he says. ""The big banks have said the deferral period is up to six months, but if the coronavirus recession drags on and people can’t return to work, this may not be long enough,"" Mr Wiltshire says.

Volatility can be our friend if we are ready to re-assess which markets, or assets, are newly formed deep-value opportunities – and which assets remain fully priced and trade accordingly.

We have seen a tremendous rush for liquidity. High-yield corporate bonds have been particularly hard hit.Credit:Rocco Fazzari Corporate bond prices have dropped to the point where there appears to be a massive disconnect between their fundamental value and the values trading in the market. Participants scrambling for cash are selling bonds at prices far below normal valuations. Changes to allow those in financial hardship to access their superannuation means super funds are also being driven to cash up by selling bonds. Lower risk “investment-grade” corporate bonds and higher risk “high-yield” corporate bonds have seen their prices plunge over the past six weeks. Even riskless assets, such as government bonds, have come under stress. Current corporate bond pricing may have significant economic implications, making it difficult for companies to efficiently raise funds, with the cost of capital high. This means they may make fewer investments and there will be less economic growth. Bond pricing is implying a dire future. If you take valuations as a direct sign of what the market expects, it says we are heading for a deep recession, with a large number of corporate defaults. The bonds from major banks such as NAB – and a large portion of the investment-grade universe (rated BBB and higher) – are most often large, well-capitalised investments. There is a high degree of confidence they will be repaid. The level of defaults in investment-grade bonds has traditionally been low, even under the most extreme of events, including the Global Financial Crisis and the 2000 recession. However, sellers now appear to be throwing valuation approaches out the window. Investment-grade bonds like NAB, which may have been trading at 100 cents in the dollar in February, were sold down to 95 cents in March. That doesn’t sound like a big move but it is for bonds. High-yield corporate bonds have been particularly hard hit. Some which normally trade at about 89 cents in the dollar are trading in the 50 cents in the dollar range. The disconnect gets wider with less-secure bonds. The more “credit heavy” the investment, the bigger the market punishment. Some of these are trading in the 40 cent range. We have seen wild price fluctuations, even in Australian government bonds. There was a mini “flash crash” in mid-March, with prices falling (yields higher) by 100 basis points in 60 seconds. That’s an enormous move, never seen before. For those comfortable with some risk and with a long-term horizon, there are significant opportunities. Returns in many credit sectors are higher than traditionally available in equities. We can’t predict the future and be assured a deep recession won’t come, but the credit market is pricing in a very pessimistic scenario and does not reflect the recovery of equities in recent weeks.

They’re bending over backwards to help customers during the coronavirus crisis. For businesses, they’re extending discounted loans, fee waivers and expedited processing. For residential mortgage holders, they’re giving up-to six-month repayment holidays. Taking a payment holiday on your home loan will cost you more in the long run.Credit:Louie Douvis However, just remember that for all of the above, for the banks it will mean short-term pain for longer-term gain. It's the opposite for borrowers, who mostly will pay more. According to RateCity, a half-year mortgage holiday towards the beginning of an average $400,000 loan at 3.54 per cent will end up costing you an extra $6000 – even if you lift your repayments afterwards, so that your loan term stays the same. That would require an extra $62 a month. And if you instead keep your payments at their original level, the loan will blow out by more than $17,000 – and 15 months! However, there are three smarter, cheaper ways than cutting your mortgage payments. Money asked loan comparison website Mozo to identify the most competitive deals with offset accounts (we disregarded home loans without real offset accounts, which are a really powerful debt-reduction tool, so looked at mortgages from authorised deposit-taking institutions only). Many borrowers are learning the hard way – as banks refuse to extend repayment holidays to people who have accelerated repayments directly into their mortgages – that paying extra into a companion, quarantined offset account is a smarter and safer move. In the global coronavirus crack-up, US financial institutions have even stopped borrowers accessing these savings, when it was assumed they could always be easily redrawn. The average variable rate for an owner occupier making principal and interest mortgage repayments is now 3.43 percent. But the best-value mortgages – the cheapest with real offset accounts – start at 2.55 per cent (HSBC, MOVE Bank, G&C Mutual Bank and Easy Street round out the top four). A move from the average advertised Big 4 package rate, at 4.51 per cent, would save $421 a month. However, you might not even have to move banks. Our largest institutions are disclosing a discount of some 0.7 per cent, and will be giving far more on the sly. Even the disclosed discount would save almost $200 a month without having to move… and you could angle for more, based on the fact you know you could be paying as little as 2.55 per cent. Interest-only mortgages have long been on the nose with Australia’s financial regulators, as they sought to deflate an overheated – and over-leveraged – property market. As such, hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders have been switched to principal and interest in recent years, to ensure they chip away at their debt. Going interest-only can as much as half your repayment overnight. It also saves you from expensively paying interest on interest, as you would if you took a total mortgage holiday. You can return to paying principal, well, just as soon as you can. My three rules for fixing a home loan interest rate are: Only ever fix half of the loan, only for a maximum of three years and only if you can get an immediate discount on your payments… and today you can. While variable rates are down 24 basis points since the start of March, the typical one-year fix has been slashed 52 points. Mozo says there are fixes of 2.09 per cent available over one, two and three years (lenders include Well Home Loans, Reduce Home Loans and ING). Just be aware that when you fix, you often can’t pay extra off the home loan, to save interest and slash your loan term. Fixed rates usually come with a substandard offset account, too.

Unfortunately, some of their offers come in a poisoned chalice. You pay a massive price for ""enjoying"" minimum monthly home-loan repayments.Credit:iStock Offers to defer mortgage payments for six months, or three months for credit-card payments, while interest and fees continue, results in lenders collecting interest on interest. Don’t fall for it – unless you have no alternative. And if you are making extra mortgage repayments, continue doing it and save tens of thousands in interest. Because of the way that compound interest works, there is little interest to be saved by making extra mortgage repayments once the term of a loan is less than 10 years. According to my loan calculators, at an interest rate of 3 per cent, a 10-year term is achieved once you can repay $970 a month for each $100,000 borrowed. For example, on the average loan of $400,000 that is a monthly payment of $3880. At the other end of the spectrum are loans written on a 30-year term. That would be $422 a month for every $100,000 borrowed. The difference in interest between these two loans is staggering. For the 10-year loan, total interest is about $63,000. For the 30-year loan, the total interest would be $207,000. Remember that home loan interest is non-tax-deductible. This means, if you are a mid-tier taxpayer, the interest on that 30-year loan would take $340,000 of your pre-tax salary. That’s a massive price to pay for “enjoying” minimum monthly home loan repayments. I have been writing about this for years and urging borrowers to get ahead in their mortgage repayments, not only to provide a safety buffer if interest rates rise or they suffer financial stress, but also to save a fortune in interest. A realistic goal is a 20-year term, which requires payments of $560 for each $100,000 borrowed – $2240 a month on a $400,000 loan. That’s only about $127 a week extra but it will cut the interest bill to $130,000. Given the undeniable benefits to borrowers of increasing their mortgage payments, I was horrified when a Commonwealth Bank (CBA) client sent me an email they had received which read: “We’re taking steps to continue providing the financial support our customers need. This is why we are making a one-off change to your home loan direct-debit repayment amount, reducing it to the current minimum required payment.” The bank then clarified that there is an “opt-out” procedure, that is, borrowers who want to continue with higher home loan repayments must go out of their way to tell the bank. Any marketing consultant will tell you that setting an “opt out” option is a major tool in getting people to make a change you would like them to. Think about it: most of us suffer from a barrage of paperwork, seldom read the fine print, and even the thought of having to go to somebody’s website and do all the hard work to “opt out” is enough to make us shudder. It is hardly likely to happen. It is therefore irresponsible of CBA to make the automatic ""opt in"" provision, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that it is just a sneaky way for it to boost its profits at a time when banks, in general, are doing it tough. The bank could just as easily have written to their customers along the lines of, “We appreciate these are tough times, but urge you to continue making your extra payments at the current level to pay off your loan as fast as possible and continue saving interest. However, if you need to reduce your payments, please contact us.” It would make that option available to those who need it. By making the proceedure a default “opt in” for lower payments, many more homeowners will cease making higher payments that are in their own best interests. The chances are high that CBA customers will ignore their email, let the bank reduce their repayments and extend the term of the mortgage by years, resulting in borrowers paying thousands of dollars of unnecessary interest.

Cash-free shops are becoming increasingly common in the new age as retailers try to limit the possible spread of the coronavirus from banknotes. Coronavirus is likely to accelerate the decline in cash usage.Credit:Tanya Lake Even paying with a plastic debit or credit card can risk spreading the virus, if it involves using your finger to key in a personal identification number (PIN). This month, banks and card companies doubled to $200 the amount you can pay with a contactless card, without entering a PIN, for a three-month period. Some of these changes — such as cashless shops — may prove temporary. However, that is unlikely to be true for the broad shifts in how we do our banking, with experts and bankers believing customers' money habits are likely to change forever. Payments consultancy The Initiatives Group says in a recent paper that use of cash and ATMs will fall into a ""steep decline"" as a result of the pandemic, as contactless and mobile payments rise. The retail payments mix in the Australian economy will be altered forevermore ""Depending upon the length of the crisis, many of these changes will become habitual and are likely to outlast the short-term impact of the virus. The retail payments mix in the Australian economy will be altered forevermore,"" authors David David Ojerholm and Lance Blockley say. Despite the concerns about spreading the virus through cash, the Bank of International Settlements says the likelihood of catching COVID-19 by handling banknotes is ""low."" It says credit-card terminals could be riskier, given the virus survives longest on non-porus materials, such as plastic. Even so, the perception of banknotes as high-risk will probably accelerate a move away from cash that was well and truly already underway. A recent Reserve Bank of Australia survey of consumers shows cash accounted for just 27 per cent of all payments in 2019, down from 37 per cent in 2016, and 62 per cent in 2010. Filling this gap has been cards – in particular debit cards. The RBA says card payments leapt from 31 per cent of the total in 2010 to 63 per cent last year. ""The majority of in-person payments are now initiated by tapping a card with contactless functionality on a terminal, and consumers are also using mobile phones and other devices to make ‘tap and go’ payments more often than they were three years ago,"" the RBA says. Aside from using plastic cards, consumers are also able to make contactless payments on mobile phones – an option used at least once a week by almost one in five people under 40 – or watches and even jewellery, such as payment rings. Ojerholm and Blockley say this trend towards paying on a mobile device will accelerate. ""Your phone may or may not be a great carrier of bacteria, but it is something you will touch anyway, so what’s the difference if you now use it for payments and avoid fiddling around with your wallet for a card,"" they say. As digital banking takes off and cash use declines, this will also affect the number of bank branches and ATMs – both of which are already falling rapidly. Banks are experiencing sharp declines in the number of people coming into branches because of social distancing rules and forced closures of small businesses who would ordinarily drop off their takings. The big-four banks, also affected by staff shortages, have between them temporarily closed about 170 branches since the pandemic lockdown began. As banks try to cut more costs, it would not be surprising if there is a wider re-think on the role of branches, resulting in more closures. Despite these changes, older Australians, in particular, are typically big cash users and their needs must be considered. A case in point is the tens of thousands of people who still bank with a passbook, and often depend on accessing a bank branch to withdraw their cash. Krissie Jones, NAB's executive general manager of retail, says the bank is ""really concerned"" that passbook customers may be in self-isolation, and lacking an alternative way to bank, so it has contacted these people encouraging them to use digital banking. ""We've had examples of customers who have been passbook customers for 40 years, and have not really wanted to change their banking but realise that there is a need right now, and are taking out a card and learning how to go about using the NAB app,"" she says.

As of mid-week, some 456,000 applications, with a value of $3.8 billion, have been made via MyGov, approved by the ATO, and on-sent to the super funds for payment. The average request is for around $8,000. The government has not taken the decision lightly to allow early release of super. But for Australians whose finances have been significantly affected by COVID-19, accessing a limited amount of super today may outweigh the benefits of locking up savings all the way to retirement. In conjunction with other measures the government has announced, such as the doubling of Jobseeker and the $130 billion Jobkeeper package, this is the largest economic lifeline in Australia’s history. Of course, early withdrawal of super is a trade-off. Some people have no choice when it comes to accessing their super early.Credit:Jason South Money withdrawn now won’t gather compound interest for retirement unless replaced down the track. But money taken out of super need not be a permanent withdrawal. We’d all want to avoid borrowing long term on a credit card, and seek to repay that as soon as the household budget permits. And when it comes to super, the government already has flexible measures in place for members to re-contribute to super when times are better, such as the option of catch-up contributions. But for those who need money now, there may be no easy options. It’s important to look at the counterfactual: the alternative might be incurring costly personal loans, credit card debt or selling the family car. If members have made the difficult decision to draw on their own savings, they will expect their super fund to release their money as quickly as possible. At a time when money is tight and there are pressing needs for families, everyone must play their part – including super funds. For our part, the government has ensured the administration is as simple as possible. Applications for early release must be made through MyGov (my.gov.au); an individual does not need to contact their super fund to make a claim. The ATO shoulders the burden of verification and assessment. So the government’s ask of the $3 trillion super industry is simple: respond to the ATO’s requests and release funds to members as quickly as possible, within five business days. That’s the benchmark set by APRA, the superannuation sector regulator. This is an opportunity for all super funds to demonstrate their commitment to their members at a time when they need it most. I’m glad to see that many funds have responded to the call, worked diligently on their systems and capacity and are standing ready to help. A number have told me that they aim not just to meet but to beat that five-day benchmark. And for any who speculate on strains in the super system, let me put this ask in context. Treasury estimates that fewer than 1.7 million Australians will apply for early release, equating to around $27 billion. This is less than one per cent of the circa $3 trillion in super funds. It’s also less than a quarter of the total that workers contributed to super last financial year. No sector of the economy is immune to COVID-19. Members will be looking to super funds to pull their weight, just like the rest of us. And others will be looking too. Any fund refusing prompt access to a member’s money after ATO approval can expect to be the focus of attention from their members, from the media and from the regulators. APRA has made its expectations clear. For those who can’t – or won’t – meet them, APRA’s new directions powers give it teeth that may well be tested.

39,/money/insurance/mortgage-insurance-no-protection-in-hard-times-20200420-p54lix.html,Mortgage insurance no protection in hard times,"Homebuyers are being slugged thousands of dollars in premiums for insurance policies that don't protect them if they default on their loan. Rather than wait an average eight years to save a 20 per cent deposit on a median-priced property, a third of homebuyers cop the hefty cost of Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) on the chin. Many borrowers mistakenly believe LMI is designed to protect them if they default on the loan.Credit:  Many borrowers mistakenly believe LMI is designed to protect them if they default on a loan, enabling them to keep their home. However, it protects only the lender if the borrower defaults. More than $844 million in new LMI policies were written by mortgage insurers last year. Now, as a growing number of homeowners scramble to read the fine print on their policies amid the economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, they are realising they are not protected. Without a 20 per cent deposit, homebuyers are usually required to take out LMI. Self-employed buyers and non-residents may also need a policy, with lenders deciding on a case-by-case basis. LMI was introduced by the federal government in 1965 to transfer the risk from lenders to insurers. It is not cheap, either. If you save a 5 per cent deposit for a $500,000 loan, you will need to pay an eye-watering $15,960 in LMI premiums. Not a cent of this covers the buyer. LMI is usually arranged by the lender during the loan approval process. The cost is agreed between the lender and the insurer, and the premium paid by the homebuyer as a one-off fee. It can be paid as a lump sum, although lenders often add the premium to the home loan amount, so it can paid it off over time, which means borrowers pay interest on the insured amount. Eligible first-home buyers can save about $10,000 in LMI costs with just a 5 per cent deposit under the government’s new First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. Another 10,000 scheme places will be available from July this year. Consumer advocate Choice called on the banking royal commission to abolish LMI, expressing concerns about a lack of choice between products and that they offered no value to consumers. “Evidence of premiums at one insurer almost five times higher than at a competitor may be indicative of extreme profiteering,” the Choice submission read. The Banking Code of Practice stopped short of abolishing the policies, but halted LMI commissions. Many first-time homebuyers do not look past interest rates when calculating how much they will pay for a new loan, overlooking LMI, Sydney mortgage broker Otto Dargan says. However, homebuyers should bear in mind that the rate that LMI is charged jumps significantly at certain borrowing thresholds. “If you’re borrowing $299,999, you will pay much less in LMI than if you borrow $300,001, even though your loan is just $2 more,” he says. The cost of LMI jumps again when you borrow more than 90 per cent of the property's value. So, a relatively small reduction in the size of your loan can result in significant savings, he says. Dargan recommends that homebuyers obtain an estimate of the LMI premium they would pay with a range of lenders and insurers. “The problem is that banks and lenders don’t actively publish the LMI premium rates of their mortgage insurer, so it’s difficult to compare,” Dargan says. However, mortgage brokers have access to this information and should compare the cost of LMI when making a recommendation, he says. Copyright © 2020", Nina Hendy ,"April 21, 2020"
40,/money/super-and-retirement/cashing-in-an-investment-property-to-make-super-contributions-20200420-p54ld5.html,Cashing in an investment property to make super contributions,"Our house was purchased in my name in 1991 for $116,000. We lived in it as our family home until June, 2012, when we rented it out. It was then valued at $650,000. It was rented until August, 2019, and has been on the market for $785,000 since then. If we sell it before June of this year am I able to make a downsizer superannuation contribution of $300,000? I am not sure whether the 10-year rule applies because of the time rented. As I will also need to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on the profit from 2012 to the sale date, am I able to make total concessional contributions of $50,000 (2 x $25,000) using the bring-forward rule, to reduce my taxable income? I have $65,000 in super now. I turned 65 last month. Would I need to pass the work test for the concessional contributions? I have had conflicting responses from my super fund and the Australian Taxation Office. You are over 65, the property has been held for at least 10 years, and is partially CGT exempt. Illustration: Simon Letch Credit:  Therefore, you would appear to be eligible to make a downsizing contribution of $300,000, provided the contribution is made within 90 days of settlement of the property sale. CGT tax will be levied on the net increase in value from when it was rented, which may be about $140,000 after all expenses. After application of the 50 per cent discount, CGT will be levied by adding $70,000 to your taxable income in the year the sales contract was signed. As your superannuation balance was less than $500,000 at June 30 last year, you can use the bring-forward rule and contribute two lots of $25,000 as tax-deductible concessional contributions – provided you can pass the work test. Just make sure you liaise closely your with an accountant and your financial advisor to get the paperwork right. No work test is required for the downsizer contribution. My friends and I are mostly retired and living off our superannuation. We are talking about the possibility of moving our super back into accumulation mode, where it is not counted for Centrelink purposes, and applying for Newstart. With our super balances decreasing quickly, it would be worth it – even if it meant we would have to apply for some jobs. Possible? That’s certainly a possibility, as long as you have not yet reached pensionable age and can satisfy the Newstart eligibility criteria. Just bear in mind that your super is not actually “decreasing quickly” – it is fluctuating in line with the market. This means some days it will be up and some days it will be down. My wife and I are retired and the vast majority of our income is generated by our Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF), which has been in existence for about 20 years. Recently, we contemplated selling our existing home and buying another, and putting an extra $300,000 towards the purchase price. We figured that with interest rates so low, it would be a good idea to borrow the additional funds, rather that sell personal or super fund investments. After discussion with my bank, ANZ, I was staggered to discover it will not take into account ANY income generated by a SMSF. I suggested to the lending manager that if she were to lose her job, she may have difficulty in meeting housing loan repayments, whilst my wife and I did not have a job and will continue to draw the minimum legally required sum from our fund. I contacted Bank of Melbourne, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac, who all assured that SMSF income would be included in their assessment of any borrowing requirement that I may have. I think you should point out to your readers that if they receive the majority of their income from a SMSF, then they should not be banking with ANZ, as there may come a time when borrowing is a necessity, and the bank will turn them down. An ANZ spokesman confirmed that the bank has a long-standing policy of not accepting SMSF income for home loan applications through their retail arm. The bank is reviewing this policy, however, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely delay the outcome of the review. In what appears to be an anomaly, the spokesman tells me that ANZ's Private Bank can accept income from SMSFs for home loan applications, however, there are still a number of checks and balances and each application is assessed on its merits. Your question highlights the fact that lenders may have very different criteria. This is why a rejection by one is not necessarily the end of the road. Don’t be frightened to shop around. I just read your latest column and you mentioned the potential of a death tax. Could you please explain how this works. There is a death tax of 15 per cent, plus Medicare levy, which applies to the taxable component of your superannuation that is left to any non-dependent in your Will. A spouse is always regarded as a dependent. I have written often about ways to mitigate it.
