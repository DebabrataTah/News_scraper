While the Australian government has not raised any issues with receiving faulty equipment, defective testing kits from China have been reported by governments in Britain, Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands.

2,/politics/federal/gas-revival-key-to-renewables-push-energy-minister-says-20200424-p54n2n.html,"Gas revival key to renewables push, Energy Minister says","Energy Minister Angus Taylor wants Australia to use the plummeting price of gas to support fast-start gas plants to get more renewable energy into the grid and deliver cheaper power to manufacturers. Coronavirus travel restrictions have caused a huge fall in global oil prices. The global gas market, which is tied to the oil price, has also dropped significantly. Angus Taylor wants Australia to use the plummeting price of gas to support fast-start gas plants. Mr Taylor expects the newly-cheap fuel supply to bring on investment in so-called fast-start gas plants, which he says will fill gaps in the energy grid created by the switch to renewable energy. ""We've seen a very significant reduction in gas prices, which is likely to be sustained for a number of years,"" Mr Taylor told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. ""It's a big opportunity not just for Australian manufacturing with lower energy costs, but also to support continued investment in renewables. ""The lower cost of gas as a stimulus is very, very important. It can help to reduce emissions, can help to encourage investment in manufacturing, and obviously has direct benefits for households and small businesses who use gas."" While not as big as Australia's traditional fleet of ageing, large scale baseload power generators, fast-start gas plants can rapidly rev up and provide so-called dispatchable power supply when large scale wind and solar generators lack their natural inputs. East Coast wholesale gas sold for $4.30 a gigajoule on the spot market this week, down from contract prices that ranged up to $12 a gigajoule earlier this year. ""Gas-related projects look much more attractive at a lower price. So whether it's an electricity generator or an ammonia plant, ethanol or petrochemicals, it creates great opportunity,"" Mr Taylor said. ""More gas means more capacity to absorb renewables [into the grid] because gas is flexible, dispatchable generation."" Mr Taylor said Australia has to ""remain competitive in upstream gas"", but that doesn't necessarily mean more onshore drilling. Victoria has removed its ban on onshore conventional gas extraction in a bid to increase supply and Santos is forging ahead with a gas project at Narrabri, NSW. Meanwhile, AGL is developing plans for an import terminal at Crib Point in Victoria, and a consortium backed by Andrew Forrest has been approved by NSW government to double the size of its planned import terminal at Port Kembla. Former BP Australasia president and Climate Council councillor Greg Bourne expects one of the proposed gas import terminals for the East Coast, which can be built more quickly and cheaply than an onshore or offshore gas field, to be developed in the near future, to capitalise on the low oil price. ""I think that would completely remove the need for Australia to worry about its onshore production capacity,"" Mr Bourne said. Mr Taylor expected growth in gas supply to ""come from natural competitiveness rather than from a huge government subsidies"" which requires ""the government to make sure that the right regulatory frameworks and reforms are in place"". Experts say for Australia to meet its commitment to the Paris Agreement, fossil fuel use must start to decline immediately, and that the contribution to global warming from gas as industrial fuel has been underestimated. Australia's export royalties could take a big hit in the fuel price crunch. Earlier this week EnergyQuest chief executive Graeme Bethune said LNG export revenue could fall by as much as $20 billion.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison emerged from a national cabinet meeting on Friday to urge teachers to return to work like supermarket workers, bus drivers and others who were working while meeting rules designed to prevent the spread of the virus. ""Their risk is not in the classroom – their risk is in the staff room,"" he said of the teachers.

People aged 19 and under accounted for 122 cases of the virus in NSW out of a state total of 2976, according to figures up to Thursday night. All but five of these have recovered. The same age group accounted for 58 cases in Victoria out of a state total of 1343 people as at Friday morning, with all but two recovered.

Mr Morrison said the updated advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee – made up of federal and state chief medical officers – did not require classrooms to meet the social distancing rules for other spaces. The usual rules are for people to stay 1.5 metres away from each other and for internal spaces to be limited to one person for every four square metres. ""They need to ensure they have social distancing happening in the lunch room and the staff room and at drop off and at pick up and their engagement with parents,"" he told Sky News on Friday after the national cabinet meeting. ""But retailers are doing the same thing right now. People are doing it in manufacturing plants, on construction sites, workers are doing it."" Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the risk of transmission in schools was low because COVID-19 was very different to influenza, which spread quickly among the young.

""There was a systematic lack of understanding of children's specific need for adequate mental health and psychosocial support in the immediate aftermath, to support their longer-term recovery and their resilience and ensure their uninterrupted psychosocial, emotional and cognitive development,"" it says.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced a string of changes to the pandemic response program late on Friday afternoon, which the government had put in place to keep workers linked to their employers. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has made some changes to the JobKeeper wage program.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen While broadly welcomed by the business community with more than 400,000 formally enrolling in the scheme this week, there have been a series of complaints about its structure and operation. They include pressures on small businesses to find a month's worth of wage payments upfront, much higher wages for almost 1.7 million part-time workers, rules governing charities and even the structure of firms. Accountants have discovered many firms have their employees listed in separate companies that fail the JobKeeper requirement to suffer a 30 per cent fall in income for operations with less than $1 billion revenue. Mr Frydenberg said on Friday that in order to protect the integrity and efficient operation of JobKeeper, a separate fall in turnover test would be created for firms that use a special purpose entity to employ their staff rather than being directly employed. The new test will include combined GST turnovers of the companies that use the entity which employs a firm's staff. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed this week concern even within businesses about the flat $1500 wage subsidy as it applied to young people earning a small amount of money.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced a string of changes to the pandemic response program late on Friday afternoon, which the government had put in place to keep workers linked to their employers. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has made some changes to the JobKeeper wage program.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen While broadly welcomed by the business community with more than 400,000 formally enrolling in the scheme this week, there have been a series of complaints about its structure and operation. They include pressures on small businesses to find a month's worth of wage payments upfront, much higher wages for almost 1.7 million part-time workers, rules governing charities and even the structure of firms. Accountants have discovered many firms have their employees listed in separate companies that fail the JobKeeper requirement to suffer a 30 per cent fall in income for operations with less than $1 billion revenue. Mr Frydenberg said on Friday that in order to protect the integrity and efficient operation of JobKeeper, a separate fall in turnover test would be created for firms that use a special purpose entity to employ their staff rather than being directly employed. The new test will include combined GST turnovers of the companies that use the entity which employs a firm's staff. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed this week concern even within businesses about the flat $1500 wage subsidy as it applied to young people earning a small amount of money. They would be paid the $1500 fortnight under the government's original design even if they were receiving less than $100. That has been now changed.

10,/politics/nsw/the-lucky-group-enjoying-fewer-constraints-under-covid-developers-20200423-p54mqg.html,The lucky group enjoying fewer constraints under COVID: developers,"The world is in shutdown, yes? Well, actually, no. You and I are in shutdown, strapped to the chair, straitjacketed and muzzled. But the land-clearers, fossil-fuel extractors, single-use plastic waste generators and grabbit-and-run developers are more avid than ever. They’re not just proceeding apace. They’re revving up. Having a ball. Artist's impression of Meriton's plan to build 1900 apartments at Little Bay in towers up to 22 storeys.Credit:Meriton Many people hope the pandemic will make humanity soften its damaging ways. And perhaps we will, we small guys. But the rules are different up there. Chances are, when this COVID nightmare ends, we’ll be Rumpelstiltskinned back into a world hurtling to oblivion. Governments impoverished by mass wage subsidy, tax loss and ballooning unemployment will be more than ever in thrall to big business. This may seem insignificant now, compared with the immediate life-and-death fears of virus land, but remember. Big Business need you to think that. It needs you passive, glued to the couch, frightened. And no, to be clear, I’m not saying rip off your mask and rush out into the streets. I’m saying exercise your mind. While you and I are dutifully swallowing our daily dose of Stan and Netflix, remnant forest is being logged, Adani is undermining the Galilee Basin, coalmines are being approved and extended and developers are rejoicing as government empowers itself to speed approvals, supercharge ministerial discretion and diminish protections. Just when you thought our cities had been thoroughly trashed by a decade-long onslaught of towers and motorways, it’s set to get worse. Just when you thought NSW’s new building commissioner would surely respond to tower buildings that crack and burn without warning by re-regulating construction, the government tips the board the other way. For government, cheered on – one might even say led – by the development lobby, has removed virtually all planning constraint during the crisis. While we stewed, housebound, through Easter, greater planning change was effected – with more haste, less fanfare, less discussion and the potential for far more dramatic consequence – than at any time since Sydney landowners ganged up on Governor Macquarie and told him what the rules really were. First, on March 24, came the COVID-19 Legislation Amendment (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 (NSW), which slid through both houses of Parliament and became law, all in a single day. That sketched a new superpower landscape. A week later, Planning Minister Rob Stokes dug a little hole and tucked into it a landmine called the Planning System Acceleration Program. It sounds innocent. Well, natch. The amended act gives Stokes between six and 12 months of virtually unlimited discretion to authorise any development on any land “without the need for any approval under the act or consent from any person”. No agreement is required from Parliament, cabinet or the department, and definitely not from the public. Nor need other legislative controls apply – heritage, environment, water. It’s just nice Mr Stokes in consultation with the Minister for Health. Those who yearn to trust government note that the minister can only make such orders if he is “reasonably satisfied” that they’re necessary to “protect the health, safety and welfare of members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic”. I say, define reasonably. Define health. The trusters murmur gently (while sloshing umbrage over any suggestion of non-COVID priorities) that such absolutism is only to enable building of hospitals and testing stations. It’s necessary, they say, to allow the conversion of a convention centre, say, to an emergency hospital. The minister would never abuse such powers. Wouldn’t he, though? Just how safe is it to bestow our trust on government in such generous quantities? Is unfettered ministerial power really good for our health? Consider. Construction was already deemed an “essential activity”, which is why half the traffic in our newly deserted streets is construction trucking. One of the minister’s first orders under the new law, on April 2, was to expand building hours so that commercial and infrastructure construction can continue through weekends and public holidays. That might still sound pretty innocuous, especially given the standard jobs-jobs-jobs catch-cry. “The extended hours allow the industry to facilitate social distancing on construction sites,” said the minister, “while minimising the potential for lost productivity during the pandemic.” So, yes, the new regime came in full PPE, guised as an essential health measure. Similarly clad was the minister’s next-day announcement of the acceleration program. The government says fast-track planning processes will keep people in jobs and the construction industry moving throughout the COVID-19 crisis. If that were the priority, though, you might expect similar support for the arts sector which generates $16.4 billion to NSW GDP and employs 118,000 FTE workers. You might think Sydney’s recent transformation by the biggest building boom in its history – leaving it strewn with cookie-cutter clumps of resi-towers and communities that, from Parramatta to Frenchs Forest, feel overwhelmed and underconsulted – indicated a lack of planning. Apparently not. Apparently Sydney is asphyxiated by red planning tape – according, at least, to developer lobby group Urban Task Force, which not only welcomed but pretty much took credit for the decision to “cut red tape and … fast-track reforms”. “We have been calling for a fast-track system for assessments of big projects for six months,” crowed the taskforce’s Tom Forrest. Six months. That’s well before anyone had heard of COVID-19. And there’s more coming. “Today’s announcement represents the start ...”  Apparently at Treasury’s request, the taskforce sent the government a list of 70 projects requiring the fast-track treatment. These include many that are “stuck” in the planning system because, let’s be frank, people detest them. Meriton’s proposal for a clutch of towers up to 22 storeys at Little Bay Cove, Bilbergia’s 440-apartment development at St Leonards, Mirvac’s proposal for West Pennant Hills and Walker Corp’s $16 billion proposal for 4000 dwellings in the Greater Macarthur Growth Area. Stokes is a nice guy. He’s also the pretty face for the much more ruthless Dominic Perrottet, whose agency – says the Urban Task Force - has been “driving planning reform in NSW”. Trust them with such unchecked power if you dare. Hand the public interest to a government that has flogged or destroyed many of our finest public assets and developed public land with enthusiasm. I say, good luck with that. Elizabeth Farrelly is a Sydney-based columnist and author who holds a PhD in architecture and several international writing awards.

11,/politics/federal/the-week-australia-stood-up-to-china-and-global-giants-20200424-p54n3c.html,The week Australia stood up to China and global giants,"It was in 1911 that the Chinese formula of ""thick face, black heart"" was first published. It summarises an ethos, the psyche of a person with ""a heart blacker than pitch and a face thicker than the Great Wall of China"". What does it mean? A thick face is one that feels no shame. A black heart has no mercy, no virtue. ""It's a wonderful metaphor for complete ruthlessness,"" says the erudite Australian Sinologist Geremie Barme. Illustration: Jim Pavlidis  Credit:  Its creator, Li Zongwu, was a politician and social commentator who wrote that ""the emperors, ministers and generals who really succeeded in Chinese imperial politics were all masters of the art of the thick and the black"", says Barme, who translated part of a book on the subject. ""It's at the heart of Chinese Communist Party politics,"" he says. And, at the moment, it is more evident to the outside world than it ever has been. Beijing is making the most outrageous and shameless claims. ""They are really going over the top,"" says Barme, ""especially in the month or so since Zhao Lijian, the up-and-coming 'Wolf Warrior' diplomat, tweeted that it was the US army that brought the conoravirus to China."" Zhao is one of the official spokespeople of China's Foreign Affairs Ministry; Wolf Warrior was a hyperpatriotic action film lauding the People's Liberation Army, the highest grossing movie ever screened in China. Zhao has emerged as something of a Chinese counterpart to Donald Trump's demagoguery. ""This stuff is beloved of all of us who appreciate the xenophobic, extremist, rabble-rousing, ratbaggery"" of the Chinese Communist Party. ""Really, it's very hard to keep a straight face."" Till now, this stuff was mostly reserved for domestic consumption. Beijing is now exporting it as part of its strategy to use the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to accelerate its plans for reshaping the world. Australia this week incurred some of this rhetorical wrath when the Morrison government calmly made a series of moves that defied Beijing. Strikingly, in some of the key initiatives, Australia led the world. But China's Communist Party doesn't have a monopoly on the art of the thick and black, or ""hou hei xue"". It's the same attitude the world has seen from the US tech titans, most prominently Google and Facebook, but also including Apple and Amazon. The four have pioneered ""a new kind of corporate extremism"" that no other US company could have got away with, according to Scott Galloway of the New York University Stern School of Business. Even after huge falls in their share prices in the COVID crunch, these four firms have a market capitalisation nearly four times the size of the total annual output of the Australian economy.This week Australia calmly defied them,too. The Morrison government announced that Australia had decided to impose a mandatory code of conduct on these corporations because efforts to negotiate a voluntary code were going nowhere. ""It's only fair that those that generate content get paid for it,"" said Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. The tech titans, which profit from the journalism of Australia's media companies, would be forced to share some of that profit with the companies that produce it. Australia wouldn't bow to their threats. ""It's a battle worth fighting,"" he said. Here, too, Australia is leading the world. Taken together, this week's decisions to defy the authoritarian superpower, China, and America's biggest companies, represent a remarkable moment in Australia's national self-assertion. Apparently out of nowhere, we see a new boldness and independence from a country that has long been considered an economic dependency of China's and a ""deputy sheriff"" of America's. What's happening? The corona crisis is accelerating history. China already was pressing hard for advantage. American leadership already was little more than a quaint memory. But the pandemic has emboldened China and embroiled America. And in Australia, it has empowered Scott Morrison. He was already immersed in the policy issues of Chinese strategy from his years on the cabinet's national security committee as treasurer. If you want a rare insight into the work of that super-secret committee, this week's release of Malcolm Turnbull's memoir provided one. He repeatedly describes China's conduct towards Australia as ""bullying"" and confirms that China attempted to coerce Australia economically. On the Chinese government's espionage intrusions, Turnbull writes that while many countries spy on Australia, ""what’s become increasingly apparent over the last decade is the industrial scale, scope and effectiveness of Chinese intelligence gathering and in particular cyberespionage. ""They do more of it than anyone else, by far, and apply more resources to it than anyone else. They target commercial secrets, especially in technology, even where they have no connection with national security. And, finally, they’re very good at it. A last point, which speaks to the growing confidence of China, is that they’re not embarrassed by being caught."" And Morrison was already deeply involved in efforts to manage the depredations of the US tech titans. He was the treasurer who launched the Digital Platforms Inquiry three years ago, for instance. The virus is accelerating events here, too. Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has pointed out that the crisis has savaged the ad revenues of Australian media businesses. On top of this policy background, Morrison has had a searing lesson in leadership in the past few months. He learned from the bushfires that inaction in a crisis is a political disaster, but from the pandemic that decisive leadership is a political triumph. Four China-related moves came in rapid succession, starting with Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne on Sunday. ""I think it’s fundamental"" she said ""we determine an independent review mechanism to examine the development of this epidemic, its development into a pandemic, the crisis that is occurring internationally."" An inquiry might seem a sensible starting point. But not in Beijing. The Foreign Ministry said it was ""gravely concerned"" at this, dismissing it as a ""political attack"" designed to ""hype up"" the situation. It sought to diminish the idea by saying Australia was ""dancing to the tune of another country"" and to ""parrot[ing] what those Americans have asserted"". You bet the Chinese Communist Party is concerned. Its new strategy to turn its COVID culpability into geopolitical gold is directly threatened by an international inquiry. An inquiry would keep scrutiny and pressure on China. Was Australia parroting America? Trump has blamed China for the pandemic, but the idea of an independent inquiry was Australia's own initiative. Second, Morrison proposed that there needs to be an international disease inspectorate to prevent future pandemics. The agency, with powers similar to those of international weapons inspector, could be the World Health Organisation, or a new body. And he took this idea to Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and others in a series phone calls. None of these has so far committed to support the concept – so much for Australia ""dancing to the tune of another country"". But New Zealand and Britain have expressed support for such a mechanism and Morrison intends to continue pressing for international agreement. Third was the South China Sea. Under cover of COVID, Beijing is pressing its claims against its neighbours' territories harder and faster. In the past month it has declared a new local government zone over a disputed part of the South China Sea. And rammed and sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat in disputed waters. In the face of this, Australia announced this week that it had sent a frigate, the HMAS Parramatta, to join three US Navy ships in exercises near an area of the South China Sea where Malaysian, Vietnamese and Chinese claims clash. And where a Chinese survey ship reportedly is searching for undersea oil. Marise Payne supported the HMAS Parramatta deployment with a statement calling on all parties to ""refrain from destabilising activities"" and concentrate on the pandemic. The defence strategist Peter Jennings suggested that Australia ""prepare for the crisis after the crisis"". The Morrison government knows full well that another made-in-China crisis is on its way. The fourth China-related Australian initiative this week was one launched by a minister who hadn't even consulted Morrison on it, much less the US. The Agriculture Minister, David Littleproud, proposed to his counterparts in the G-20 this week an independent scientific inquiry into wet markets for wild animals entirely on his own initiative. The chief veterinary officer in Littleproud's department, Mark Schipp, told the minister that wet markets for wild animals have generated six pandemics in recent decades. It was time to do something about it instead of just waiting for the seventh, Littleproud decided. ""I went straight to my department and I simply went to the G-20,"" he tells me. ""We understand the sensitivity China may have about the origins of this disease but it's international good practice to Learn from a crisis."" He got no statements of support from any other G-20 minister. ""I am challenging the G-20 to lead this. It's important that we have open conversations about these events that impact lives and the food security of nations. Let us as the G-20 undertake the work and share it with the developing countries"" that most need help with it. Wet markets for wild animals, says Littleproud, are a cocktail that just explodes every so many years, ""so you just have to take away the ingredients"". He emphasises that the problem isn't wet markets themselves, but the trade in wild animals. It's this element that needs to be ""isolated and eliminated"". Littleproud says that while Australia will pursue the idea, Schipp will also pursue it in his capacity as chair of the World Organisation for Animal Health. They'll need all the help they can get. We know the Chinese response will be incendiary. Australia has not made any splashy declaratory new China policy, or returned rhetorical fire, and Geremie Barme says that this is exactly the right response. ""The smart thing is not to engage rhetorically, you act."" That's exactly what Australia is doing. Not only in defending its interests against China but against the biggest of American big businesses as well. You don't need a thick face or black heart to defend your rightful national interests. You do need determination and independence. Australia the lickspittle, it seems, is becoming a lion.   Peter Hartcher is political editor and international editor of The Sydney Morning Herald.

12,/politics/federal/a-quieter-anzac-day-can-be-just-as-heartfelt-20200424-p54mz1.html,A quieter Anzac Day can be just as heartfelt,"For many Australians, young and old, Anzac Day is steeped in tradition. Early mornings, candle-lit vigils, street parades, games of two-up, tales of battle and camaraderie. The sounds of the Last Post ringing out over bowed heads and silent crowds. But, as with so many other cherished traditions, COVID-19 has changed the way we celebrate Anzac Day as well. With all the usual events and gatherings cancelled, those wanting to participate in some form of remembrance have had to take a more creative and housebound approach. It has involved some improvisation but that is also a sort of Anzac tradition. Veterans Bill Sowry and Terry James stepped into the breach, with their Driveway at Dawn movement. At 6am on Saturday, many Australians are expected to stand in front of their home with a candle or torch, observing the traditional minute's silence, then sharing it on social media with the hashtag #standto. Many might also tune into a modified version of the dawn service at the National War Memorial which starts at 5.30am. Many others might download an app that plays the Last Post on a bugle. While the challenges of today may seem all-pervading, the sacrifices of those who served in wars and conflicts past and present should be top of mind. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, during which more than 39,000 Australians died while serving. At a time when Australia's population was just over 7 million, it was a very heavy toll. For those active in operations today – there are hundreds serving in the Middle East, the Pacific and patrolling Australia's northern borders – it should be a moment to wish them well and a safe journey home. But the constraints in which we live today cannot be ignored. In another break with tradition, supermarkets have announced they will remain open on Anzac Day morning. Some will regret this distraction from remembrance but it is an unfortunate necessity. If stores had opened only in the afternoon as normal it would have created a crush of customers in breach of the rules on social distancing. Sadly, the traditional Anzac Day appeal is struggling to raise funds for veterans and their families because volunteers cannot sell their poppy lapel buttons on the streets. Usually this is a time to honour veterans. For many of them, Anzac Day is a time of companionship, a time to renew friendships forged in battle. But older veterans are now among the most vulnerable to the coronavirus and therefore most in need of our protection and support. It is a duty that can be shared by all. Everyone who plays their part in following the social distancing rules is helping to safeguard them and, in doing so, honour their service. This will be an Anzac Day like no other. It will be deserted at Anzac Cove, where Australian backpackers would sit in reverence as the sun rose, honouring the battles that forged a nation. It will be deserted at Villers-Bretonneux, where the horrific struggles on the Western Front that cost the lives of more than 10,000 Australians are remembered. The cenotaph in Martin Place will not be graced by the traditional marching and laying of wreaths. It will be deserted in hundreds of small towns across Australia where locals would normally come together to lay wreaths and parade proudly down main streets, reflecting on the terrible toll war often had on small communities. But for all that has been lost, let us ensure we honour the memories that in years past brought us together. Anzac Day is ultimately not about the marches and dawn services but about something inside ourselves. It was only decades after the Gallipoli landing that many of the traditions we now observe were developed. In those early days the remembrance was often simply a day of quiet reflection by veterans and the widows and families in grief of the dead. It was simpler but it was certainly no less heartfelt. This is a time when Australians in a small way are being called on to show the sense of mateship that has been the hallmark of Anzac Day. Some of us will show our sense of public spirit by the unheroic act of staying at home. But there are medical staff taking risks treating infectious patients. This is a time when we can reflect on what the Anzac legend says about a fair go and self-sacrifice. Let this Anzac Day be one to remember. Let it be a day when Australians coming together does not have to mean being together. We will remember them, no matter what circumstances we may find ourselves in.

After spending weeks working on getting stranded Australians home, the foreign affairs minister will now turn her attention to advancing Australia’s interests in the post-COVID-19 world. But the media-shy Payne will need to finally embrace the limelight to succeed on this mission.

It took a major car accident at the age of 19, in which she broke her neck, to spark her to change course and go straight into politics after completing her law degree. By her late 20s, she had been president of the NSW Young Liberals, the party’s first female national Young Liberals president and a private secretary to Opposition frontbencher Robert Hill. After a stint as the vice-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, serving under chairman Malcolm Turnbull, she was elected to the Senate on the NSW Liberal ticket in 1997. It would be a long spell on the backbench in the Howard government. While her progressive brand of liberalism annoyed some on the conservative side of the party, she quietly gained respect within defence and diplomatic circles in her role as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. When Tony Abbott became prime minister, she was appointed human services minister. After Turnbull toppled Abbott for the leadership in 2015, although still a relative unknown in wider circles, she was the obvious choice to become Australia’s first female defence minister. After a significant churn over the past decade with many politicians finishing their careers in the defence portfolio, Payne quickly earned the respect of the top brass. She escaped doing a lot of media, with the publicity-hungry Christopher Pyne in the defence industry portfolio taking up the slack. Neil James is the executive director of the Australia Defence Association, an independent watchdog that monitors issues of national security and defence. He tells The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that Payne displayed an ability to push back against her department and was never driven by ideology. He says of the last “28 or 29 defence ministers, she would be in the top 10”. “She will make a decision, she will question departmental advice when it needs to be questioned,” says James. Marise Payne will push for an independent body to probe the spread of COVID-19.Credit:Illustration: Matt Davidson When Scott Morrison succeeded Turnbull, Morrison chose Payne as Julie Bishop’s replacement as foreign affairs minister on Bishop's recommendation. The quiet diplomacy of Payne was always going to be a change of pace from the media-savvy Bishop. Payne entered the role as Australia was set to navigate the most uncertain period in foreign policy since the end of World War II. Does the nation accede to China’s rise? Somehow maintain the United States as the regional hegemon? Or transition to a multipolar region where Beijing is accommodated but counterbalanced by a number of regional powers including the US, India, Indonesia and Japan? With COVID-19 ravaging countries all over the world, these challenges have not been abated; in fact, they will only intensify in the wake of the pandemic. Up until now, most of Payne's days have been preoccupied with rescuing Australians stranded overseas, something which her Labor counterpart Penny Wong says she has not done nearly quick enough. Interviewed on the ABC’s Insiders program, Payne revealed she will push for an independent body outside the World Health Organisation to probe the spread of COVID-19. The WHO has come under criticism for being too close to China and not alerting the world soon enough to the global pandemic. While the Chinese embassy in Australia was quick to claim Australia was being Donald Trump’s mouthpiece in attacking the WHO, Payne’s call for a global inquiry into the world health body should not be conflated with the United States president's allegations. Australia is taking its stance on the WHO out of a position of strength in fighting the spread of coronavirus, Trump from one of weakness. Replay   Although only a middle power on the world stage, Payne and Morrison see a need for Australia to take the lead in pushing for a review, with many bigger countries, including Britain and the US, still battling major outbreaks of the deadly pandemic. Payne on Thursday also condemned Beijing’s recent actions in the South China Sea which have included the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat. Her long-time friend and Canberra housemate, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham, says Payne fills people with confidence when she speaks publicly, ""but also shows more discipline than most of us by only speaking when she is certain she has something to say"". ""As most would expect, she’s stepped up both privately in her work with Scott [Morrison] and engagement with countries across the globe, but also publicly in recent weeks,"" Birmingham tells The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “I think in some ways Marise has probably been preparing for the portfolio and a complex scenario like this for her entire 20-year career. She brings to my mind the values, judgment and discipline required to navigate the most complex of circumstances and that’s evidenced through recent weeks through having to span everything from working with DFAT as a virtual travel agency on tens of thousands of consular cases of Australians stranded around the world, to the highly challenging policy questions of how to reform the World Health Organisation and manage the deeply strategic challenges around how to navigate our relationship with China."" Liberal MP Tim Wilson, a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party, says it was important for Payne to strongly state Australia’s national interests. “Marise has brought a precise, calm and substantive assertiveness that is sending a clear message, with the Prime Minister, that the Australian government knows where it stands, will stand up for our sovereignty and national interest and can’t be intimidated - and that is very welcome in difficult times,” says Wilson. With China likely to oppose the move, Payne will now need to convince the rest of the international community to sign up to a global review independent of the WHO. Any reform of the WHO needs to bring the US back on board and not place the world body further into the hands of China, while not completely isolating Beijing at the same time. And, while hard-working and across her brief, Payne’s reluctance to front the cameras has at times irked her colleagues. She has bolstered her office over the past year leading to a more hawkish approach to China, including the addition of Turnbull’s former national security advisor Justin Bassi as her chief of staff. Her rate of appearances, and her performances, have improved markedly over that time period, including during the global pandemic. However, as the most senior female MP in the government, some of her colleagues think it is still nowhere near enough.

The new guidance confirms teachers and students will not need to stay more than 1.5 metres away from each other in the classroom, pushing back against union demands for continued online learning at home. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the 1.5 metre social distancing rules don't apply in classrooms.Credit:Shutterstock While state governments are at odds over when to bring all students back to school, the state and federal chief medical officers issued updated advice to assure parents the classrooms could be kept safe. NSW health officials are also preparing to release a report this weekend that has not found significant evidence that children are transmitting the virus in schools, even in cases where students were found to be infected. Prime Minister Scott Morrison emerged from a national cabinet meeting on Friday to urge teachers to return to work like supermarket workers, bus drivers and others who were working while meeting rules designed to prevent the spread of the virus. ""Their risk is not in the classroom – their risk is in the staff room,"" he said of the teachers. Replay   State figures show that infections among school-age children make up a very small proportion of COVID-19 cases across the country. People aged 19 and under accounted for 122 cases of the virus in NSW out of a state total of 2976, according to figures up to Thursday night. All but five of these have recovered. The same age group accounted for 58 cases in Victoria out of a state total of 1343 people as at Friday morning, with all but two recovered. One the active cases is a teenage boy and the other is a girl aged 4 and under. Of the 1026 cases in Queensland up to midday on Friday, only 48 were aged 19 or under. but the state government declined to say how many had recovered. There have been 17 cases in South Australia among those aged 19 and under, out of a state total of 438, and all have recovered. There are more than 1.2 million school students in NSW, more than 990,000 in Victoria and more than 830,000 in Queensland, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Mr Morrison said the updated advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee – made up of federal and state chief medical officers – did not require classrooms to meet the social distancing rules for other spaces. The usual rules are for people to stay 1.5 metres away from each other and for internal spaces to be limited to one person for every four square metres. ""They need to ensure they have social distancing happening in the lunch room and the staff room and at drop off and at pick up and their engagement with parents,"" he told Sky News on Friday after the national cabinet meeting. ""But retailers are doing the same thing right now. People are doing it in manufacturing plants, on construction sites, workers are doing it."" Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the risk of transmission in schools was low because COVID-19 was very different to influenza, which spread quickly among the young. ""Most children who have contracted the virus in Australia have contracted it in the family home,"" Professor Murphy said. Asked whether the low rates among children reflected a lack of testing in that age group, Professor Murphy rejected this concern and pointed to the imminent NSW study. ""We don't have evidence of significant infection in children, and, more importantly, we are not seeing evidence of significant transmission amongst children in schools,"" he said. ""New South Wales Health have just done a very large study looking at some infections that have occurred in the school setting and have tested a lot of children [and] have not found evidence that children are transmitting this virus in schools."" The report by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance for NSW Health is due to be released on Sunday. In another clash between federal and state governments on schools, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton accused Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of ""running scared"" of the Queensland Teachers' Union because she would not resume full classes. The union told members they should not allow too many children back to the classroom because it would be ""physically impossible"" to meet the social distancing rules, but the statement was made before the AHPPC confirmed the 1.5 metre rule did not apply.

Well, actually, no. You and I are in shutdown, strapped to the chair, straitjacketed and muzzled. But the land-clearers, fossil-fuel extractors, single-use plastic waste generators and grabbit-and-run developers are more avid than ever. They’re not just proceeding apace. They’re revving up. Having a ball. Artist's impression of Meriton's plan to build 1900 apartments at Little Bay in towers up to 22 storeys.Credit:Meriton Many people hope the pandemic will make humanity soften its damaging ways. And perhaps we will, we small guys. But the rules are different up there. Chances are, when this COVID nightmare ends, we’ll be Rumpelstiltskinned back into a world hurtling to oblivion. Governments impoverished by mass wage subsidy, tax loss and ballooning unemployment will be more than ever in thrall to big business. This may seem insignificant now, compared with the immediate life-and-death fears of virus land, but remember. Big Business need you to think that. It needs you passive, glued to the couch, frightened. And no, to be clear, I’m not saying rip off your mask and rush out into the streets. I’m saying exercise your mind. While you and I are dutifully swallowing our daily dose of Stan and Netflix, remnant forest is being logged, Adani is undermining the Galilee Basin, coalmines are being approved and extended and developers are rejoicing as government empowers itself to speed approvals, supercharge ministerial discretion and diminish protections. Just when you thought our cities had been thoroughly trashed by a decade-long onslaught of towers and motorways, it’s set to get worse. Just when you thought NSW’s new building commissioner would surely respond to tower buildings that crack and burn without warning by re-regulating construction, the government tips the board the other way. For government, cheered on – one might even say led – by the development lobby, has removed virtually all planning constraint during the crisis. While we stewed, housebound, through Easter, greater planning change was effected – with more haste, less fanfare, less discussion and the potential for far more dramatic consequence – than at any time since Sydney landowners ganged up on Governor Macquarie and told him what the rules really were. First, on March 24, came the COVID-19 Legislation Amendment (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 (NSW), which slid through both houses of Parliament and became law, all in a single day. That sketched a new superpower landscape. A week later, Planning Minister Rob Stokes dug a little hole and tucked into it a landmine called the Planning System Acceleration Program. It sounds innocent. Well, natch. The amended act gives Stokes between six and 12 months of virtually unlimited discretion to authorise any development on any land “without the need for any approval under the act or consent from any person”. No agreement is required from Parliament, cabinet or the department, and definitely not from the public. Nor need other legislative controls apply – heritage, environment, water. It’s just nice Mr Stokes in consultation with the Minister for Health. Those who yearn to trust government note that the minister can only make such orders if he is “reasonably satisfied” that they’re necessary to “protect the health, safety and welfare of members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic”. I say, define reasonably. Define health. The trusters murmur gently (while sloshing umbrage over any suggestion of non-COVID priorities) that such absolutism is only to enable building of hospitals and testing stations. It’s necessary, they say, to allow the conversion of a convention centre, say, to an emergency hospital. The minister would never abuse such powers. Wouldn’t he, though? Just how safe is it to bestow our trust on government in such generous quantities? Is unfettered ministerial power really good for our health? Consider. Construction was already deemed an “essential activity”, which is why half the traffic in our newly deserted streets is construction trucking. One of the minister’s first orders under the new law, on April 2, was to expand building hours so that commercial and infrastructure construction can continue through weekends and public holidays. That might still sound pretty innocuous, especially given the standard jobs-jobs-jobs catch-cry. “The extended hours allow the industry to facilitate social distancing on construction sites,” said the minister, “while minimising the potential for lost productivity during the pandemic.” So, yes, the new regime came in full PPE, guised as an essential health measure. Similarly clad was the minister’s next-day announcement of the acceleration program. The government says fast-track planning processes will keep people in jobs and the construction industry moving throughout the COVID-19 crisis. If that were the priority, though, you might expect similar support for the arts sector which generates $16.4 billion to NSW GDP and employs 118,000 FTE workers. You might think Sydney’s recent transformation by the biggest building boom in its history – leaving it strewn with cookie-cutter clumps of resi-towers and communities that, from Parramatta to Frenchs Forest, feel overwhelmed and underconsulted – indicated a lack of planning. Apparently not. Apparently Sydney is asphyxiated by red planning tape – according, at least, to developer lobby group Urban Task Force, which not only welcomed but pretty much took credit for the decision to “cut red tape and … fast-track reforms”. “We have been calling for a fast-track system for assessments of big projects for six months,” crowed the taskforce’s Tom Forrest. Six months. That’s well before anyone had heard of COVID-19. And there’s more coming. “Today’s announcement represents the start ...”  Apparently at Treasury’s request, the taskforce sent the government a list of 70 projects requiring the fast-track treatment. These include many that are “stuck” in the planning system because, let’s be frank, people detest them. Meriton’s proposal for a clutch of towers up to 22 storeys at Little Bay Cove, Bilbergia’s 440-apartment development at St Leonards, Mirvac’s proposal for West Pennant Hills and Walker Corp’s $16 billion proposal for 4000 dwellings in the Greater Macarthur Growth Area. Stokes is a nice guy. He’s also the pretty face for the much more ruthless Dominic Perrottet, whose agency – says the Urban Task Force - has been “driving planning reform in NSW”. Trust them with such unchecked power if you dare. Hand the public interest to a government that has flogged or destroyed many of our finest public assets and developed public land with enthusiasm. I say, good luck with that. Elizabeth Farrelly is a Sydney-based columnist and author who holds a PhD in architecture and several international writing awards.

Just when you thought NSW’s new building commissioner would surely respond to tower buildings that crack and burn without warning by re-regulating construction, the government tips the board the other way. For government, cheered on – one might even say led – by the development lobby, has removed virtually all planning constraint during the crisis. While we stewed, housebound, through Easter, greater planning change was effected – with more haste, less fanfare, less discussion and the potential for far more dramatic consequence – than at any time since Sydney landowners ganged up on Governor Macquarie and told him what the rules really were. First, on March 24, came the COVID-19 Legislation Amendment (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 (NSW), which slid through both houses of Parliament and became law, all in a single day. That sketched a new superpower landscape. A week later, Planning Minister Rob Stokes dug a little hole and tucked into it a landmine called the Planning System Acceleration Program. It sounds innocent. Well, natch. The amended act gives Stokes between six and 12 months of virtually unlimited discretion to authorise any development on any land “without the need for any approval under the act or consent from any person”. No agreement is required from Parliament, cabinet or the department, and definitely not from the public. Nor need other legislative controls apply – heritage, environment, water. It’s just nice Mr Stokes in consultation with the Minister for Health. Those who yearn to trust government note that the minister can only make such orders if he is “reasonably satisfied” that they’re necessary to “protect the health, safety and welfare of members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic”. I say, define reasonably. Define health. The trusters murmur gently (while sloshing umbrage over any suggestion of non-COVID priorities) that such absolutism is only to enable building of hospitals and testing stations. It’s necessary, they say, to allow the conversion of a convention centre, say, to an emergency hospital. The minister would never abuse such powers. Wouldn’t he, though? Just how safe is it to bestow our trust on government in such generous quantities? Is unfettered ministerial power really good for our health? Consider. Construction was already deemed an “essential activity”, which is why half the traffic in our newly deserted streets is construction trucking. One of the minister’s first orders under the new law, on April 2, was to expand building hours so that commercial and infrastructure construction can continue through weekends and public holidays. That might still sound pretty innocuous, especially given the standard jobs-jobs-jobs catch-cry. “The extended hours allow the industry to facilitate social distancing on construction sites,” said the minister, “while minimising the potential for lost productivity during the pandemic.” So, yes, the new regime came in full PPE, guised as an essential health measure. Similarly clad was the minister’s next-day announcement of the acceleration program. The government says fast-track planning processes will keep people in jobs and the construction industry moving throughout the COVID-19 crisis. If that were the priority, though, you might expect similar support for the arts sector which generates $16.4 billion to NSW GDP and employs 118,000 FTE workers. You might think Sydney’s recent transformation by the biggest building boom in its history – leaving it strewn with cookie-cutter clumps of resi-towers and communities that, from Parramatta to Frenchs Forest, feel overwhelmed and underconsulted – indicated a lack of planning. Apparently not. Apparently Sydney is asphyxiated by red planning tape – according, at least, to developer lobby group Urban Task Force, which not only welcomed but pretty much took credit for the decision to “cut red tape and … fast-track reforms”. “We have been calling for a fast-track system for assessments of big projects for six months,” crowed the taskforce’s Tom Forrest. Six months. That’s well before anyone had heard of COVID-19. And there’s more coming. “Today’s announcement represents the start ...”  Apparently at Treasury’s request, the taskforce sent the government a list of 70 projects requiring the fast-track treatment. These include many that are “stuck” in the planning system because, let’s be frank, people detest them. Meriton’s proposal for a clutch of towers up to 22 storeys at Little Bay Cove, Bilbergia’s 440-apartment development at St Leonards, Mirvac’s proposal for West Pennant Hills and Walker Corp’s $16 billion proposal for 4000 dwellings in the Greater Macarthur Growth Area. Stokes is a nice guy. He’s also the pretty face for the much more ruthless Dominic Perrottet, whose agency – says the Urban Task Force - has been “driving planning reform in NSW”. Trust them with such unchecked power if you dare. Hand the public interest to a government that has flogged or destroyed many of our finest public assets and developed public land with enthusiasm.

Andrew Constance: ""Doubt is important. It’s important to doubt yourself because it gives you the ability to reflect on making sure what you are doing is right. If you don’t doubt yourself, you’re not human.""Credit: Jennifer Constance You were once NSW treasurer. What was that like?To be honest with you, it was a bit of an unnatural fit. I went from being disability services minister – where you’re able to really help people – to being locked up in meeting after meeting in the backrooms of government. Now, as NSW Transport Minister, you’ve been overseeing huge – often controversial – infrastructure projects, the costs of many of which have blown out.We’ve also delivered the Northwest Metro $1 billion under budget. Sydney’s new light rail was really hard for everybody – particularly residents and businesses – but I put in a program which delivered, on average, to successful businesses about $215,000 each to get them through. You deliver the reforms from Uber to taxis, to betterment strategies around the Opal public transport smartcard, but it’s a thankless task. How much does a NSW state MP get paid?There’s the base salary: around 150 or 160 grand. Then, on top of that, ministerial [wages] and allowances. Is it commensurate with the work you do?Well, one thing about politicians is that you have to do lots of things the community doesn’t see, particularly as a minister. You’ve said that you won’t be recontesting the next NSW state election. What’s Plan B? How will you make money post-politics?[Laughs] Money hasn’t really come into my thinking just yet. I was incredibly traumatised in January and February. I recently drove through some fire-affected areas after a funeral, and just couldn’t believe the level of destruction. It still shocks me. Now there’s the added devastation of coronavirus. That financial hit must be hard-felt in your electorate.From the moment the NSW South Coast bushfires started in the last week of November, people lost work. Casuals were laid off. Businesses folded. People were and are hurting. And it’s very hard for any politician at the moment – it doesn’t matter if it’s the prime minister or the premier – to be able to stand with confidence, to tell people there’s a pathway out of this. Are you a man of faith?I was baptised Anglican and then confirmed Anglican when I was a teenager. Is Anglican what you tick on the census now?Oh, yeah. I’m just not one who goes to church every Sunday. But you believe in God?I believe, but it’s not my place in political life to bring religion into everyday politics. Most Australians believe that it’s a private matter. That’s very much how I see it. Has what’s happened to you, your family and the community you live in over the past few months shaken your faith at all?I haven’t thought about it like that. I’ve seen so much pain, but I don’t sort of wake up every morning and question my faith, when the practicalities of pain are there for everyone. On the flip side of belief is doubt. When you’re a politician, is doubt an asset or a liability?Doubt is important. It’s important to doubt yourself because it gives you the ability to reflect on making sure what you are doing is right. If you don’t doubt yourself, you’re not human. Outside of religion, what keeps you grounded?Strong friendships. The bushfires reset a number of relationships for me, and I’ve found incredible solace in people I wasn’t close to before. Rob and Jen across the road, Steve and Mandy; I’ve formed lifelong bonds with my neighbours. They’ve gone from being neighbours you’d say g’day to over the fence to lifelong friends who I care about deeply. It feels like death has permeated our whole conversation already, given that so many homes in your electorate were destroyed by the fires.Yeah, around the 950 mark. You know, the morning the fire came through, I thought I was gone. There were a couple of occasions that day when I honestly thought, “I’m not gonna live past today.” None of us is immortal. The fires burned right up to the front of your house. You’ve spoken frankly about living with trauma and grief as a result. What is helping you manage?In 2011, I had a head-on car accident. During that experience, I honestly thought it was over for my former wife and our four-year-old in the car. I had significant post-traumatic stress after that, so I do know that you can come out of it. But you can only come out with the right help. Now, for thousands of people, [counselling services] are completely on hold, even though it’s not the type of thing you can put on hold. We’ve got people lifting shattered pieces from the fire and unable to get the necessary support. The virus couldn’t have come at a worse time for healing. Have these near-death experiences made you more or less afraid of the idea that you’ll die one day?It’s had an interesting effect. I have zero filters towards political work now. It’s probably been the healthiest thing that could happen. People in the community can sense emotional detachment, so this is all forcing community and business leaders to become grounded again. What’s your advice for people experiencing grief and trauma, whether through the fires or coronavirus?It’s all about connection and kindness. It doesn’t take much to pick up the phone and have a yak to someone. Even though we’ve got to maintain distance physically, emotional connection is really important because we’re all scared.

""I'm a teacher and so I really struggled with not having a schedule at first so I needed something like this because it gave me a plan to work with,"" Ms Bunting said. The Berejiklian government will boost funding to Tresillian to ensure free access to the app as part of its $73 million COVID-19 mental health package to be announced on Friday. It comes as the federal government announced on Thursday night $6 million in additional funding will be divided between online and phone drug and alcohol support services. In NSW, more than 180 mental health workers will be deployed as part of its package to bolster mental health services during the pandemic.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Mental Health Minister Bronnie Taylor said the funding will help support the mental health and wellbeing of people across the state. Ms Berejiklian said the extra mental health staff and new digital resources would ensure anyone who requires support was able to access it. ""We know how challenging the past few months have been.

NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman confirmed on Thursday he has requested the advice from the Department of Communities and Justice about a ban, which follows a flag being displayed from a Newtown home at the weekend. The NSW government is looking to ban Nazi flags after a swastika was flown on a Newtown house at the weekend.  ""These symbols of hatred and anti-Semitism are unacceptable anywhere in our community,"" Mr Speakman said. ""They are deeply offensive and capable of traumatising survivors of genocide and their loved ones. The small but disgraceful minority who display these images insult the memory of the millions of victims of the Holocaust and those who died defending the world from this hatred."" Labor frontbencher Walt Secord, who is also deputy chair of the NSW Parliamentary Friends of Israel group, urged the government to consider a ban and Liberal MP for Vaucluse Gabrielle Upton wrote to Mr Speakman on Monday. In her letter, Ms Upton asked Mr Speakman to ""identify the best ways the government can end this totally offensive and deplorable use of the Nazi flag"". A swastika was painted over a mural along Bondi Beach's promenade last year. Credit:Australian Jewish News Mr Secord said he welcomed the move by Mr Speakman, saying while he wanted the flag ban it should go through the proper process and be referred to the Attorney-General's department. ""The Nazi flag is deeply offensive to veterans who fought against fascism and was an affront to survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants,"" Mr Secord said. ""The Nazi flag is an emblem of genocide and racism."" Mr Secord, who is an associate member of the Emanuel Synagogue in Woollahra, said recent incidents which include a swastika painted at Bondi Beach and physical attacks on a person on the way to prayer were symbols of a ""despicable shift in our community"". ""The decision to fly a Nazi flag is a simple expression of hatred,"" he said. The NSW government introduced race hate laws in 2018. People who incite or threaten violence against anyone on the grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation or HIV status face a three-year jail term and $11,000 fine. Mr Speakman said anyone affected by this conduct should contact police and urged anyone who believed they have been vilified to also contact Anti-Discrimination NSW and lodge a complaint.

The NSW government is looking to ban Nazi flags after a swastika was flown on a Newtown house at the weekend.  ""These symbols of hatred and anti-Semitism are unacceptable anywhere in our community,"" Mr Speakman said. ""They are deeply offensive and capable of traumatising survivors of genocide and their loved ones. The small but disgraceful minority who display these images insult the memory of the millions of victims of the Holocaust and those who died defending the world from this hatred."" Labor frontbencher Walt Secord, who is also deputy chair of the NSW Parliamentary Friends of Israel group, urged the government to consider a ban and Liberal MP for Vaucluse Gabrielle Upton wrote to Mr Speakman on Monday. In her letter, Ms Upton asked Mr Speakman to ""identify the best ways the government can end this totally offensive and deplorable use of the Nazi flag"". A swastika was painted over a mural along Bondi Beach's promenade last year. Credit:Australian Jewish News Mr Secord said he welcomed the move by Mr Speakman, saying while he wanted the flag ban it should go through the proper process and be referred to the Attorney-General's department. ""The Nazi flag is deeply offensive to veterans who fought against fascism and was an affront to survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants,"" Mr Secord said. ""The Nazi flag is an emblem of genocide and racism."" Mr Secord, who is an associate member of the Emanuel Synagogue in Woollahra, said recent incidents which include a swastika painted at Bondi Beach and physical attacks on a person on the way to prayer were symbols of a ""despicable shift in our community"". ""The decision to fly a Nazi flag is a simple expression of hatred,"" he said. The NSW government introduced race hate laws in 2018. People who incite or threaten violence against anyone on the grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation or HIV status face a three-year jail term and $11,000 fine. Mr Speakman said anyone affected by this conduct should contact police and urged anyone who believed they have been vilified to also contact Anti-Discrimination NSW and lodge a complaint.

34,/politics/victoria/the-road-to-recovery-are-victoria-s-mega-projects-still-worth-it-20200423-p54mja.html,The road to recovery: Are Victoria's mega-projects still worth it?,"Comb through government funding records for 1932, the year unemployment peaked at 32 per cent during the Great Depression, and you will find £5000 set aside for a significant road project in Victoria. Replay   The money was part of “an unemployment relief fund used to widen the Great Ocean Road and provide work for more than 200 returned soldiers”. The road – now one of Australia’s biggest tourist attractions – shows the legacy governments can leave when trying to boost a collapsed economy. Almost a century later Victoria is staring at another savage economic downturn, of a magnitude not seen since the Depression, and certainly since the state’s last recession in 1991. Premier Daniel Andrews has fronted the media almost daily since calling a state of emergency in March, with a forceful focus on staving off a health catastrophe. But the economic woes coronavirus could wreak upon Victoria may be as big a challenge as the health crisis, with state treasury estimates this week predicting a quarter of a million Victorians will soon be out of work – twice the current number. To cope with the economic battering, Victoria will borrow up to $24.5 billion in extra cash. Premier Daniel Andrews at Carrum Station in January.Credit:Jason South Andrews has regularly said construction will be one of the ways his government digs Victoria out of the crisis. “We are going to need to do more in road and rail. It will need to,” he said this week, ""go to another level”. But with the state’s infrastructure drive already at what most thought “next level” before the pandemic, can Victoria realistically contemplate embarking on more mega-projects – builds with price tags in excess of $1 billion? Or could the pandemic provide a sort of reset, where Daniel Andrews relaxes his focus on big builds and instead turns the state towards other infrastructure to get the economy pumping again? 'We've been conned into a major projects approach' Andrews this week said his government’s choice of projects had always been both big and little, with the state’s massive transport build packaged up so that “small firms, medium firms and large big tier-one firms” got work. Four immense transport projects are either underway in Victoria, or might already have been signed off had the pandemic not ground the state to a halt. The West Gate Tunnel motorway is under construction, bidding is underway for the North East Link toll road and freeway widening, plans for an airport rail line were close to finalised, and the Metro Tunnel rail line is being built. Then there is the $50 billion Suburban Rail Loop, on which the bill for planning alone comes to $300million. Is it wise to forge ahead with all of these enormous projects? “No” was the resounding answer from financial and planning experts quizzed by The Age this week. The prevailing view was that while city-shaping projects are nice in theory, their enormous lead times and vast cost reduce their wider community benefit. “More smaller projects, you can turn the tap on and off easier,” said economist Terry Rawnsley, from consultants SGS. “You don’t want to get in a position where in five years’ time you’ve built [major] projects and maxed out the credit card.” Some projects put forward by the Andrews government also don’t make as much sense as they once did, with COVID-19 likely to see population growth dip, travel patterns change and a recession if not worse.  “We’ve been conned into a major projects approach,” said economist John Stanley, a Sydney University transport professor and former Victorian transport industry executive. He said costly projects like the Suburban Rail Loop were “grossly over-designed” and shorter-term public transport projects that helped people navigate Melbourne’s suburbs made more sense. The North East Link done “more modestly” might benefit the city but its vast cost meant it should be postponed, he said. The proposed suburban rail loop would intersect with 10 other rail lines.Credit:Fairfax Media If past practice is anything to go by, Andrews is unlikely to back down. He has pushed through virtually all promised projects – even the troubled-plagued West Gate Tunnel. John Hearsch, president of transport think tank the Rail Futures Institute, said the $50 billion Suburban Rail Loop – the most expensive transport project in Victorian history – needed rethinking, as did the North East Link. His group wants to see a $2 billion City Loop reworking built to expand trains flowing through – swiftly delivering the equivalent of a 10-lane freeway. Electrification of trains to Melton and Wyndham Vale must go ahead too even if the pandemic causes public transport journeys to dip, he added. Other smaller-scale rail projects where federal money is already on the table such as light rail for Doncaster, electrifying trains past Frankston to Baxter and duplicating rail tracks in Geelong’s Waurn Ponds should also proceed, others said. The Victorian government needs to talk to Bombardier about new trams, say experts, as part of boosting the economy.Credit:Govnews Victoria But simply ramping up construction would not avert wide-scale unemployment, Hearsch said. For this reason, an extra 100 new trams should be built in Dandenong by Bombardier, along with more locally made buses. Public Transport Users Association’s spokesman Tony Morton agreed, noting that much spending on multibillion-dollar projects wound up spent on expensive machinery – not wages. He said Victoria’s Treasury had an “ideological conviction” that spending was better on capital projects like new rail station car parks than on state-run operations such as a better bus network, which increased jobs both in manufacturing and driving. “A feeder bus can deliver passengers to the station all day,” he said. “It doesn’t depend on the car park getting full after the first 200 passengers drive in.” Stimulus: the lessons of history Victoria has of course seen this show before, even if the script is more dramatic now, said respected economist Saul Eslake, who pointed to the enormous stimulus packages of the early 1990s recession. Then, prime minister Paul Keating’s One Nation package funded a range of huge infrastructure projects. “By the time these got started, the recession was well and truly over,” said Eslake, who believes the nation’s biggest states such as Victoria and New South Wales need to concentrate not on mega-projects but genuinely “shovel-ready” works. Treasurer Wayne Swan and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announce their economic stimulus package during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.Credit:Glen McCurtayne He said the Rudd government’s school halls program during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis partially worked because it was spread “around the country, rather than concentrated in a few areas as is typically the case with large projects”. It also required locally sourced labour and materials. Of course there was a downside: “A lot of schools got halls that they didn’t need.” Also funded in Rudd's GFC response was the Regional Rail Link through Melbourne’s west. A success as a transport project, but an abject failure as a stimulus measure. Billed as “shovel ready” in 2009, it took two years to start. Eslake was among a range of voices The Age spoke to who said the biggest success story from the Rudd-Swan stimulus was housing for the poor. In particular, it fitted the need for speed. Across Australia 20,000 new social housing units were built and another 12,000 got repairs. A KPMG spending review found the most vulnerable - the homeless, disabled and elderly - were the beneficiaries. In Victoria, Eslake said, where social housing as a percentage of total housing stock is low, home-building was an ideal focus point to lift the economy. It would also calm the jangled nerves of many in the sector. Construction expert and RMIT professor Ron Wakefield is also a director of Launch Housing, which has helped the state house 700 homeless people during the crisis. “When the pandemic finishes, they will just get pushed back onto the streets,” he said. A once-in-a-generation home-building program would create jobs and tackle the housing crisis affecting many Victorians before the pandemic, he said, and meant Victoria was “not putting everything into roads and trains”. Overseas cities beset by pandemic lockdowns have also urgently pushed cycling and walking projects into action, said Monash University planning lecturer Liz Taylor. “There are so many Melbourne projects shelved for ages that could quickly be reprioritised,” pointing to the west’s Federation cycling trail as a prime example. She said while the economic uplift and job creation from building new active transport infrastructure was minute on the scale of mega-projects, they would leave a lasting legacy. She said pouring millions into permanent bus lanes should also be considered because coronavirus might change travel patterns long-term. “Travel demand for cars will be lower, just from changes to people’s working-from-home habits."" The dangers of getting stung Another lesson from Australia’s GFC response, economist Rawnsley said, was another shovel-ready project commissioned back then: Peninsula Link. The road improved trip times to the Mornington Peninsula but failed to deliver many other promised benefits. And it proved a “sweet deal” for the project’s private-sector consortium, Rawnsley said. Taxpayers are now paying around $100 million a year until 2037, a total of $2.75 billion for a road built for just $651 million nine years ago. The case showed the Victorian public can get stung when state governments hastily dust off long-planned projects and start construction to boost the economy. Melbourne's West Gate Tunnel is among the massive infrastructure projects that need renewed scrutiny.Credit:Luis Enrique Ascui “The view on this was at the time the economy was falling off a cliff and the state was happy to pay a bit more,” he said, “to make sure things were happening.” As builders grow increasingly risk-averse in the face of a deepening recession, Daniel Andrews may be forced to pay a premium for the major projects he does build – whether trying to repair the state’s economy or not. Rawnsley doubted the $16 billion North East Link would deliver bang for the bucks, and questioned its legacy beyond getting trucks off Heidelberg’s Rosanna Road. And in the face of global travel bans, Rawnsley warned an airport rail link costing between $8 billion and $13 billion might be dubious. “The imperative for the rail link,” he said, “has kind of disappeared overnight.” However, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia's chief executive Adrian Dwyer said maintaining a pipeline of mega-projects was important, in addition to prioritising $50-$500 million projects and fast-tracking level crossing removals. Keeping the construction industry open during the crisis was also a ""master stroke"" by the Victorian government he said, because it saved jobs and built industry confidence. Where will the growth come from? The key unknown in the crisis, the Grattan Institute’s city and transport head Marion Terrill says, is how quickly the economy will recover if social distancing continues for years in the absence of a vaccine. “Traditionally we tend to grow our way out of debt. After World War II, we grew fast and debt dwindled to nothing and that works as long as the economy is growing faster than interest rates on government borrowing,” Terrill said. ""At the moment, it’s hard to imagine a lot of economic growth.” Borrowing while interest rates were radically low to build infrastructure was a good idea, but it was crucial the money went towards projects that increased productivity and matched the needs of a changing world, she said. “You can waste money cheaply as well as expensively.” The risk in marching ahead with major transport projects already being promoted by the Andrews government is that many of their underlying assumptions – surging population growth and travel patterns – have now been turned on their head by COVID-19. And those changes could be permanent: commuters may be less inclined to travel on overcrowded trains and more people may work from home, putting less strain on transport. It was time for the government to stop and think about what projects the state truly needed. “The big projects are particularly risky right now,” Terrill said.

The Liberals, who say they are considering their options, may lodge the claim for economic hardship despite selling their former headquarters for $37 million less than two years ago. The party’s key decision-making group agreed on Thursday to allow state director Sam McQuestin to explore access to the payments despite some senior figures conceding it was a “bad look”. The party's weak financial position has left it prepared to defy the internal warnings about political embarrassment associated with tapping a multi-billion dollar bailout designed by its federal branch. ""Exploring all options""  Liberal Party state director Sam McQuestinCredit:Philip Biggs The JobKeeper allowance, a $130 billion plan hatched by the state Liberals' federal colleagues as part of the Morrison government's massive financial response to the COVID-19 crisis, is designed to keep workers attached to their jobs, even if they are stood down by employers who cannot afford to pay them. Mr McQuestin told The Age on Friday that he was exploring all ways available to preserve the jobs and incomes of the party’s 12 employees. The Victorian Labor Party’s state secretary did not return calls on Friday. But ALP sources said there were no immediate financial worries at the party’s Docklands HQ, where about 20 backroom workers are employed, with the union affiliation fees which underpin Labor’s finances so far unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Liberals’ ruling administrative committee discussed the party’s parlous finances on Thursday night with sources confirming the committee voted in favour of allowing Mr McQuestin to examine whether they were eligible for the JobKeeper payments. But one administrative committee member, who asked not to be named, warned against the political wisdom of accessing the payments even if the party was eligible. “This is a very bad look,” the senior Liberal said. “This isn’t meant for businesses with millions of dollars in the bank."" The sharp decline in donations, as the coronavirus crisis deepened, is among the factors that has damaged the party’s ability to raise funds, prompting the decision to consider asking for government support.

Mr McQuestin said that any application would comply with the eligibility requirements that apply to all employers. “Like all employers, the Liberal Party is examining all available ways to preserve the jobs and income of as many of its employees as possible during this unprecedented crisis,” the state director said. “Any application that is made will be in accordance with the eligibility and other requirements applicable to all employers.” The JobKeeper payment allows businesses to access government subsidies of $1500 a fortnight for each of their workers. The government payments will flow to businesses each month beginning in May.

Government sources who would not be identified said Treasury officials were reassessing the state’s most expensive road project, as bureaucrats review Labor’s multibillion-dollar infrastructure pipeline to prepare for a looming recession.  Transport Minister Jacinta Allan says construction projects will enable the state’s economy to be rebuilt after the crisis.Credit:Jason South Key election promises including the $50 billion Suburban Rail Loop and the airport rail link, expected to cost between $8 billion and $13 billion, are also being reassessed in light of the pandemic, the sources said. Despite the concerns, Transport Infrastructure Minister Jacinta Allan said on Friday the North East Link would proceed, along with the rail line to the airport and the Suburban Rail Loop – the most expensive transport project ever considered in Victoria. Ms Allan said construction projects would enable the state’s economy to be rebuilt after the crisis. “We won’t stop delivering the projects Victoria needs,” she said. “We will build Airport Rail, North East Link, Suburban Rail Loop and every project we promised to deliver.” Tendering to build the 26-kilometre North East Link, which connects the Metropolitan Ring Road in Greensborough to the Eastern Freeway in Bulleen, continues despite attempts by some councils to stop the project in court. Four councils took Planning Minister Richard Wynne to the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking to overturn his approval for the project. An artist's impression of a section of the North East Link. Major construction on the  project is due to start next year.Credit:Victorian Government Banyule, Boroondara, Whitehorse and Manningham councils argue the environmental effects statement underpinning the project was vastly inadequate and must be redone. Friday's hearing resulted in Justice Greg Garde ordering the government to produce evidence refuting arguments by the councils by next month, before a trial in September. Major construction on the North East Link is due to start next year, but government sources, the construction industry and even those involved in bidding to build the North East Link said the coronavirus pandemic had heightened uncertainty about the project. The North East Link is viewed as high-risk by construction companies bidding to build it, with two of the three shortlisted consortiums refusing to bear financial liability for cost blowouts or delays. One consortium has pulled out altogether. Government sources said Treasury officials were also questioning the widening of the Eastern Freeway and a $7 billion to $9 billion tunnel beneath environmentally sensitive parts of Bulleen and Rosanna. Victoria’s transport bureaucracy has been asked to review the state’s infrastructure pipeline because of the pandemic, sources said. Officials will pick out priority projects to build in the short-term as stimulatory measures, while some projects could be delayed or cancelled outright. Infrastructure Partnerships Australia’s chief executive, Adrian Dwyer, said that while maintaining the scale of the state’s transport program was important, it made sense to review all projects in light of COVID-19. “There will be a necessary and legitimate assessment of the forward pipeline of projects,” Mr Dwyer said. “It’s very sensible.” The construction industry – which accounts for about 10 per cent of Victoria’s financial activity – will be key to stimulating the economy, and builders and investors expected clarity on the future pipeline in coming weeks. “The private sector wants to know what they’ll be bidding on in the next couple of years,” Mr Dwyer said. Transport infrastructure lawyer David Donnelly, previously an adviser on the $11 billion Metro Tunnel as well as major projects in Melbourne and Sydney, said it was prudent that the government re-prioritise big builds before a recession. “I don’t think they’ll be judged too harshly for reassessing election promises in light of the current circumstances. I just think they need to be open with the public about the fact that they’re doing that.” Mr Donnelly said the government would probably retain the North East Link because of the significant number of jobs it would create, but said the airport rail link would probably be delayed owing to uncertainty around aviation numbers and public transport patronage. The bulk of funding to build the $50 billion Suburban Rail Loop would not be spent for years, with the project due to be built by 2050, he said. Opposition transport infrastructure spokesman David Davis said transport construction was key to re-energising the Victorian economy after the pandemic, but said projects needed to drive employment, deliver wider economic benefits and have “current and relevant cost-benefit analysis”.

Dr Young said while the flyover was not health risk, it set a dangerous precedent. ""There is no health risk for someone getting in a plane - of course there isn't. But the health risk is that if one person does that then someone else will say, 'Well, maybe there is no health risk for some other things',"" she said.

The decision to dump the $68.5 million plan to replace the state's ageing laboratory information system was announced at the tail-end of a government press release earlier this month. Queensland Health director-general John Wakefield said more programs may need to be suspended ""as we scale up our efforts to fight the pandemic"".Credit:Dan Peled/AAP Queensland Health Director General Dr John Wakefield said the reason to ""discontinue"" the 10-year project was to ""to ensure pathology services are not disrupted during the outbreak"". But Health Minister Steven Miles said the project would not continue, even after the pandemic was over. ""That particular project was already under review; the legacy product that is currently in all of our labs had its support period extended from 2019 to 2029. ""That platform is stable, it is well supported by users and so for that reason the governance board was already considering ... already reviewing that project. ""Then of course COVID-19 came along, which made the decision relatively easy."" A 2012 government audit found the current system, AUSLAB, which is more than 20 years old, was one of the most high-risk systems in the Queensland's public sector. Mr Miles said it was considered ""risky"" back in 2012 because, at that stage, the ""support period"" was set to run out in 2019. Work on Queensland Health's climate change strategy, its Medicines and Poisons framework, and  its Rapid Results Program will also be put on hold during the COVID-19 crisis. “More programs may need to be suspended as we scale up our efforts to fight the pandemic,"" Dr Wakefield said. “We need to make difficult decisions to ensure our workforce is kept safe and in the best position possible to help fellow Queenslanders.” The decision to scrap and delay programs comes as the state plans to ramp up testing of all people who have symptoms of the coronavirus. “We know that if you come forward and if you have COVID-19, the quicker you are to isolate yourself from the rest of the world, the better,” Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said. Two new cases of COVID-19 were detected in Queensland overnight, amid plans to train more public servants in contract tracing. Both new cases were acquired overseas. A total of 1026 Queenslanders have been infected with the virus since late January, at least 738 of whom have recovered, and six people have died. The state has recorded just 10 new cases this week: zero on Monday and Wednesday; six on Tuesday; and two each on Thursday and Friday.

Eligible tenants are those who have lost their job, applied for Centrelink support, have less than $10,000 in savings and are still paying at least 25 per cent of their income in rent. The grants would be provided in addition to negotiations between tenants and landlords. A $24.5 million scheme has been developed to keep the construction industry ticking over and workers employeees which includes $10 million for an immediate one-off payment of $2000 to employers of apprentices and trainees. A new $9.5 million grants program will see payments to construction employers of between $250 and $500 a month to keep their apprentices on board. Apprentices and trainees will also be able to access $1000 for further training during the pandemic. According to figures from the ATO’s single touch payroll system released earlier this week the construction sector has shaved 4.3 per cent of jobs since mid-March. Construction is one of the biggest and most lucrative employers in WA. Premier Mark McGowan described the current economic situation the state faced as ‘dire’ and said the new packages were about looking after vulnerable businesses, landlords and tenants during the pandemic. Treasurer Ben Wyatt said the measures were about allowing businesses to hibernate. “Grants will be available on a first-come, first-served basis to encourage landlords to negotiate early with tenants who are doing it tough as a result of COVID-19,” he said. “We’ve opted to provide targeted assistance that supports both tenants and landlords of commercial and residential properties.” Mr Wyatt said the government was looking for stimulus and recovery measures that would give the government the best ‘bang for buck’. “We have to be careful we spend only on things that are actually going to work,” he said. “We can’t just spend money on things that might be on a wish list or things that people might like to see.” Building and Construction Industry Training Board chair Reg Howard-Smith said the construction sector was an essential service to the WA economy and the new support package would ensure the industry was well-positioned for the post-coronavirus recovery. Civil Contractors Federation chief executive Andy Graham congratulated the state government and construction training fund for moving quickly to support the construction sector. “Our industry is feeling the effects of the crisis, with some projects being deferred and margins on existing projects eroded due to higher costs,” he said. “This bonus payment will help civil contractors to maintain their workforces as they deal with these financial pressures. Access to skilled local workers will be essential in the years ahead as the civil construction sector constructs and maintains the infrastructure needed to keep our state prosperous.” Shelter WA chief executive Michelle Mackenzie said the package coupled with the moratorium on evictions will ensure many WA renters have housing security during the COVID-19 pandemic. “This package gives landlords the reassurance that tenants affected by COVID-19 can access support from the state government to help pay their rent,"" she said.

But Opposition Leader Liza Harvey said the voluntary plan would not be tolerated in any other workplace. WA Opposition Leader Liza Harvey.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola There are more than 220 advisers and support staff working for Labor's 17 government ministers, with an annual salary bill in excess of $20 million. Many are political operatives, known as ""term-of-government"" staffers, who are employed until the state election and receive generous payouts if their party loses office. A source, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns their job could be under threat for speaking out, said political staffers had been asked to contribute up to $200 a fortnight to help pay for Labor's election campaign costs. But it is understood the amount requested by the party of the highest paid staff was actually $100 a fortnight. This had created some angst inside ministerial offices, with concern the term-of-government contracts of those failing to pay up might not be renewed if the party wins office. But a state government spokesman said the fundraising system was voluntary. ""WA Labor has established a voluntary recurrent donation system,"" he said in a statement issued by Premier Mark McGowan's office. ""How people in any work place choose to engage with political parties is a matter for them."" Ms Harvey said the fundraising system was an attempt to redirect taxpayer money to the Labor Party by heavy-handed means. ""There is an implied threat that if you don’t pay part of your salary to the Labor Party, then your job is on the line,"" she said. ""The Premier as the head of the public sector and head of the WA Parliamentary Labor Party needs to explain what role he played in this cash-for-jobs scandal and he must immediately undertake an investigation of this gross politicisation of the public service. ""It shows a lack of moral compass and it's wrong. Any decent-minded employer would not do this to their staff."" The practice of using political staff paid from the public purse to raise campaign funds is commonplace in the eastern states and federally, but is unique in WA. WA Labor has been left cash-strapped after revelations money raised by state MPs had been ploughed into Bill Shorten's failed attempt to win the 2019 federal election along with about $500,000 combined on the Perth byelection and Darling Range byelections. It is unknown how much the party expects to raise by targeting state political staffers, but depending on take-up of the scheme, it could be tens of thousands of dollars. While WA Labor's state secretary Tim Picton didn't comment on the plan, Liberal state director Sam Calabrese said, ""it would be highly inappropriate if the Labor Party is pressuring public servants to fund their election campaign"". Each of the state's 17 ministerial offices costs on average $3.3 million to operate and support. Although staff working for ministers are not supposed to campaign during elections, the ministerial resources – including employees – at the government's disposal weigh heavily in favour of the party in office. It is common practice for state ministerial staffers to take leave to work on state or federal election campaigns, such as the 2019 federal election or the 2018 Darling Range byelection. Under the former Barnett government, staffers were required to take leave without pay to campaign. ""Ministerial staff are obligated to act in accordance with the Public Sector Management Act when it comes to activity during any campaign period,"" the state government spokesman said. As of February, there were 22.4 full-time equivalent staff working in the Premier's office according to records tabled in Parliament. The next most populated ministerial office was Environment Minister Stephen Dawson, with 16 full-time staff.

""The member for Kalamunda is gravely mistaken if, after three years of service on the committee, he thinks that the process is about a recommendation from the nominating committee,"" he said. ""It is factually incorrect. It is at the heart of the system that the nominating committee simply provides three names and the recommendation is then provided by the Premier to the standing committee. ""We cannot have a member of the other place serving on this important committee with this level of ineptitude, incompetence and lack of integrity."" Mr Goiran, who served for eight years on the JSCCCC, said Mr McGowan's ""ham-fisted approach to this matter"" had made it untenable for Mr McKechnie to continue as commissioner. He said the nature of the committee meant it received evidence in closed hearings and it had previously refused to appoint a premier's nominee as CCC commissioner for operational reasons. ""Instead of the Premier and Attorney General carrying on as they did at the press conference the other day, which was the most despicable thing I have seen for a long time, they might just take a moment to pause and some cooler heads in government might say to them, 'listen, this has happened before and that is why the system needs to be as robust as it is',"" Mr Goiran said. ""We cannot have the member for Kalamunda showing this level of incompetence and continuing to serve on that committee."" Labor is attempting to change the law to write Mr McKechnie's name into legislation as the CCC commissioner, which would override checks and balances intended to prevent political appointments to what is one of the most powerful government posts in WA. Ms Harvey said yesterday the Liberal Party had decided not to support the legislation, despite backing Mr McKechnie's reappointment as CCC commissioner. Mr McGowan said he had resubmitted Mr McKechnie's nomination to the JSCCCC. Nathan is WAtoday's political reporter and the winner of the 2019 Arthur Lovekin Prize for Excellence in Journalism.
