4,/national/victoria/who-says-crime-doesn-t-pay-welcome-to-the-naked-city-podcast-20200422-p54m7l.html,Who says crime doesn't pay? Welcome to the Naked City podcast,"Some people say I talk too much. This is most unfair as I am overflowing (hence the expression full of it) with endlessly amusing anecdotes and it would be most unfair not to share them with friends and strangers alike. Replay   My children claim to have been sent into zombie-like trances on family car trips as they were told the location of every Melbourne murder since 1923. The daughter’s primary school teacher was quite strangely outraged when she wrote in an assignment that while watching the evening news she asked her father if he knew anything “amusing”. He told her the shortened history of Melbourne’s underworld war – including how Carl Williams was shot in the guts on his 29th birthday. The teacher wrote in capitals: “THIS IS NOT AMUSING!"" Tell it to the Walkley judges. Her worst mark in secondary school was when I helped her produce a newspaper-style project. I was shattered. She was delighted. Damn you Miss Tridle. Thank goodness she missed out on the present home schooling model. She would have ended up a psychopath. For some time now a former colleague has urged me to tell these priceless anecdotes into a microphone to be reproduced into something called a podcast. (I suspect that is because there is a mute button. Something that doesn’t work in real life.) This led me to rat around in several secret places to rescue tapes - micro ones, cassette ones and even VHS ones (short for Video Home System). It turned out to be a treasure trove of crime material - a 30-year history of Australia’s dark arts. I gathered a box of this audio history and gave it to 3AW sound boffins to reproduce as digital recordings. They looked as if I was asking them to turn a smoke signal into a text message. Yet after finding old micro tape machines and sundry antiques they managed the feat. The tapes acted as a memory trigger for stories transcribed in scrapbooks. A pleasant chat with Mick Gatto.
Credit:Patrick Scala Such as sitting with Mick Gatto in his heavily-fortified home while he explained what happened when in 2004 he shot dead hitman Andrew Veniamin in what a jury accepted was self-defence. Or going back to Easter Thursday, 1986, when a group of crooks set a car bomb to explode right outside the Russell Street police station at lunchtime. Dozens were injured and police constable Angela Taylor lost her life. The red-hot suspect was explosives expert, Nazi sympathiser and police hater Phillip Grant Wilson, who was appearing in the Magistrates Court across the road from the station that very day. I was on leave down at Apollo Bay at the time of the bombing, but Wilson managed to make contact, saying he needed to see me. With good reason. He knew he was the number one suspect, feared he might be shot by police and wanted it put on the record that he was innocent. That night, just over a kilometre from the locked-down bomb site, he told me he was not involved (he was a killer but not that killer): “I’m not a bad sort of guy. I don’t need to hurt people. I never have. I don’t hate anyone. I’ve got a forgiving nature.” Phillip 'The Iceman' Wilson being led into court. He was critical of his nemesis, armed robbery squad detective John Morrish, who he believed had set against him. When Wilson was shot dead 17 months later outside a Richmond chiropractor's, Morrish was considered a suspect. “I was accused of having some complicity in his demise,” he would tell me in another taped interview. He had the perfect alibi as he was in the police club with 200 witnesses. Asked if he would have had time to slip out, commit the murder and return, he said that was impossible because it was this reporter's shout and he wasn’t going to miss that to kill a crook. Fair point. In those days homicide detectives asked suspects to co-operate in video reconstructions. It was amazing how enthusiastically some would participate. Frankston serial killer Paul Charles Denyer got on his hands and knees to dig out the buried purse of one of his victims, emerging triumphantly with the key piece of evidence. In one case a homicide detective asks the killer: “What did you do then?” Killer: “I went and got the gun.” Detective: “Did you want to kill him?” Killer: “F---ing oath ... He said 'Don’t Wayne’, then boom. I blew him away.” In the 1980s Victoria Police went through a period of killing suspects at an unprecedented rate. In each case the police who fired the fatal shots completed a reconstruction. We have every one of them. One of the most infamous crimes in Australia was the attempted murder of NSW undercover detective Mick Drury, who in 1984 was shot in his Sydney home. The would-be killer was hitman Christopher Dale Flannery and the go-between was uber-corrupt cop Roger Rogerson. Detective Sergeant Roger Rogerson: Beginning of the end.Credit:Fairfax Media The man who paid for the job was drug dealer Allan Williams, who thought that with Drury out of the way he would beat his Melbourne heroin charges. It was near midnight in a small office on a deserted floor of a newspaper office when Williams told me his story, that when Drury refused a bribe he agreed to pay for his murder. ‘‘I was a giant in the trade; I thought I was invincible and unpinchable. But I stepped over the line with the Drury thing. It is something I will regret for the rest of my life.’’ Back then I didn’t know why he was keen to talk. Listening now I finally understand. Williams had made statements against Rogerson and had done time for the attempted hit on Drury. He wanted me to tell the underworld that he had only dobbed in a crooked copper and that did not make him an underworld informer. He was saying to fellow heavyweight crooks: ''Don’t worry, I won’t turn on you."" It was the same logic that led drug boss Carl Williams to think if he informed on former drug squad detective Paul Dale he wouldn’t be branded a dog by the rest of the underworld. The fact he was murdered 10 years ago in prison indicates it was a fatal misjudgement. A few years after our interview, Allan Williams was dying from a drug-related blood disease and vowed to kill retired Melbourne detective Brian Murphy. (Perhaps they fell out after Murphy threatened to bite off Williams’ nose.) I immediately warned Murphy to be on guard. In this podcast Brian says when he took his grandchildren to a Carlton restaurant the owner said: “Allan Williams has been in here, he’s got a gun and he’s asking everybody where you are because he wants to kill you.” Brian Murphy. I told him his life was in danger.Credit:John Silvester A few days later I told Murphy Williams was in hospital and wouldn’t be coming out. Sometimes the real true crime story is something no one could make up. Everyone knew serial killer Peter Norris Dupas killed Mersina Halvagis in November 1997 as she tended her grandmother’s grave at the Fawkner cemetery. Her wonderful father George fought for years for justice but the prosecutors lacked that final piece of evidence. It came from the most unlikely source. Andrew Fraser was a criminal lawyer, hated by many police, who had been convicted on cocaine charges. Fraser did time with Dupas and a policeman reinvestigating the case rang him in prison, fully expecting the former lawyer to tell him to clear off. Instead Fraser said: “What took you so long?” Dupas was already serving a life sentence and it is to the credit of the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Paul (later Justice) Coghlan, that the case was run at all. He felt the Halvagis family had the right to hear the truth. Dupas was convicted and they had their day in court. Fraser and I were not close but when I approached him, he agreed to tell his story. After the trial he was broke and could have done paid media interviews. Instead he stuck to our handshake (remember those?) agreement. James ""Jim Jim"" Brandes, aka Sleepy Jim, was sent from the US to Australia by the Hells Angels to kill policemen Bob Armstrong and Steele Waterman. Seen here after being detained at Melbourne Airport in August 1982.  Doing the podcast has given me the chance to catch up with a few serious characters who are now long retired. Brian Murphy was in his workshop listening to classical music and making furniture for his grandkids. Steele Waterman was one of the first police to take on the Hells Angels and managed to persuade a key member to give up the secrets, including how they had their own man on a jury to make sure they wouldn’t be convicted of serious drug charges. When the gang brought out a US Hells Angels hitman to kill two local police, they nabbed him at Melbourne Airport, urinated on his club jacket and chucked him on the next plane out, telling him to piss off - literally. Nick Cecil, one of Australia’s first undercover police, talks about his attempts to catch Great Train Robber Ronald Biggs and how he would take the Biggs kids back to his house to play with his own children. Former armed robbery squad detective Ken Ashworth talks of his quite unique relationship with master escaper and prolific stick-up man Chris Binse. The Naked City podcasts begin on April 29.

That night, just over a kilometre from the locked-down bomb site, he told me he was not involved (he was a killer but not that killer): “I’m not a bad sort of guy. I don’t need to hurt people. I never have. I don’t hate anyone. I’ve got a forgiving nature.” Phillip 'The Iceman' Wilson being led into court. He was critical of his nemesis, armed robbery squad detective John Morrish, who he believed had set against him. When Wilson was shot dead 17 months later outside a Richmond chiropractor's, Morrish was considered a suspect. “I was accused of having some complicity in his demise,” he would tell me in another taped interview. He had the perfect alibi as he was in the police club with 200 witnesses. Asked if he would have had time to slip out, commit the murder and return, he said that was impossible because it was this reporter's shout and he wasn’t going to miss that to kill a crook. Fair point. In those days homicide detectives asked suspects to co-operate in video reconstructions. It was amazing how enthusiastically some would participate. Frankston serial killer Paul Charles Denyer got on his hands and knees to dig out the buried purse of one of his victims, emerging triumphantly with the key piece of evidence. In one case a homicide detective asks the killer: “What did you do then?” Killer: “I went and got the gun.” Detective: “Did you want to kill him?” Killer: “F---ing oath ... He said 'Don’t Wayne’, then boom. I blew him away.” In the 1980s Victoria Police went through a period of killing suspects at an unprecedented rate. In each case the police who fired the fatal shots completed a reconstruction. We have every one of them. One of the most infamous crimes in Australia was the attempted murder of NSW undercover detective Mick Drury, who in 1984 was shot in his Sydney home. The would-be killer was hitman Christopher Dale Flannery and the go-between was uber-corrupt cop Roger Rogerson. Detective Sergeant Roger Rogerson: Beginning of the end.Credit:Fairfax Media The man who paid for the job was drug dealer Allan Williams, who thought that with Drury out of the way he would beat his Melbourne heroin charges. It was near midnight in a small office on a deserted floor of a newspaper office when Williams told me his story, that when Drury refused a bribe he agreed to pay for his murder. ‘‘I was a giant in the trade; I thought I was invincible and unpinchable. But I stepped over the line with the Drury thing. It is something I will regret for the rest of my life.’’ Back then I didn’t know why he was keen to talk. Listening now I finally understand. Williams had made statements against Rogerson and had done time for the attempted hit on Drury. He wanted me to tell the underworld that he had only dobbed in a crooked copper and that did not make him an underworld informer. He was saying to fellow heavyweight crooks: ''Don’t worry, I won’t turn on you."" It was the same logic that led drug boss Carl Williams to think if he informed on former drug squad detective Paul Dale he wouldn’t be branded a dog by the rest of the underworld. The fact he was murdered 10 years ago in prison indicates it was a fatal misjudgement. A few years after our interview, Allan Williams was dying from a drug-related blood disease and vowed to kill retired Melbourne detective Brian Murphy. (Perhaps they fell out after Murphy threatened to bite off Williams’ nose.) I immediately warned Murphy to be on guard. In this podcast Brian says when he took his grandchildren to a Carlton restaurant the owner said: “Allan Williams has been in here, he’s got a gun and he’s asking everybody where you are because he wants to kill you.” Brian Murphy. I told him his life was in danger.Credit:John Silvester A few days later I told Murphy Williams was in hospital and wouldn’t be coming out. Sometimes the real true crime story is something no one could make up. Everyone knew serial killer Peter Norris Dupas killed Mersina Halvagis in November 1997 as she tended her grandmother’s grave at the Fawkner cemetery. Her wonderful father George fought for years for justice but the prosecutors lacked that final piece of evidence. It came from the most unlikely source. Andrew Fraser was a criminal lawyer, hated by many police, who had been convicted on cocaine charges. Fraser did time with Dupas and a policeman reinvestigating the case rang him in prison, fully expecting the former lawyer to tell him to clear off. Instead Fraser said: “What took you so long?” Dupas was already serving a life sentence and it is to the credit of the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Paul (later Justice) Coghlan, that the case was run at all. He felt the Halvagis family had the right to hear the truth. Dupas was convicted and they had their day in court. Fraser and I were not close but when I approached him, he agreed to tell his story. After the trial he was broke and could have done paid media interviews. Instead he stuck to our handshake (remember those?) agreement. James ""Jim Jim"" Brandes, aka Sleepy Jim, was sent from the US to Australia by the Hells Angels to kill policemen Bob Armstrong and Steele Waterman. Seen here after being detained at Melbourne Airport in August 1982.  Doing the podcast has given me the chance to catch up with a few serious characters who are now long retired. Brian Murphy was in his workshop listening to classical music and making furniture for his grandkids. Steele Waterman was one of the first police to take on the Hells Angels and managed to persuade a key member to give up the secrets, including how they had their own man on a jury to make sure they wouldn’t be convicted of serious drug charges. When the gang brought out a US Hells Angels hitman to kill two local police, they nabbed him at Melbourne Airport, urinated on his club jacket and chucked him on the next plane out, telling him to piss off - literally. Nick Cecil, one of Australia’s first undercover police, talks about his attempts to catch Great Train Robber Ronald Biggs and how he would take the Biggs kids back to his house to play with his own children. Former armed robbery squad detective Ken Ashworth talks of his quite unique relationship with master escaper and prolific stick-up man Chris Binse. The Naked City podcasts begin on April 29.

The cold mists of April nights settle among deserted gravestones, only to be burned off by spring sunshine with no one to witness it. A plague is abroad. Anzac Day is cancelled — even here, among the tens of thousands of the long dead. Replay   They are paradoxically beautiful, those rows of headstones within their tended oases: 31 cemeteries for the lost of Australia, New Zealand, Britain, India and Newfoundland, a single graveyard for the French, and more than 50 gravesites, memorials and cemeteries dedicated to the Turkish defenders. Here is where Australians and New Zealanders, having sailed from the other side of the world, learned the hideous meaning of war. In our new century, April routinely draws thousands of a new generation from both those countries to this scrubby landscape with its dusty ridges, there to drift among the graves and to crowd the shore, awaiting the dawn and a bugler’s Last Post. In recent years, even warnings of terrorist attacks have not been enough to dissuade the crowds from coming for Anzac Day. But in 2020, a global desperation has condemned the old place to the status of the silent, desolate outpost it became for years after the armies that had tried and failed to wrest it from the Ottoman Empire had sailed away, leaving tens of thousands of bodies in the hills. This week, a well-known Gallipoli guide and tour operator, Ilhami ""TJ"" Gezici, ventured to the peninsula and took a series of photos of Anzac Cove, Lone Pine, Shrapnel Valley and other famous spots. All of them were empty of human life. ""There’s nothing eerie about the photos when you look at them,"" wrote TJ. The cemetery at Lone Pine this week. It is closed to visitors. Credit:TJ (Ilhami Gezici) ""But the feeling of standing on the peninsula without any tourists and just the sounds of nature is both a privilege and a sadness that leaves you with a great sense of loss for the world."" The coronavirus crisis, then, has done what no one might have imagined: cancelled Anzac Day at the very place it earned its name. The rhetoric of national leaders, rich with the imagery of military combat and calls for national sacrifice, suggested an explanation of sorts: the pandemic is so monstrous we have plunged into a new form of world war. French President Emmanuel Macron, announcing his decision last month to invoke a national lockdown, stated several times ""we are at war"". In the days before COVID-19 almost killed him, Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, reaching for a Churchillian flourish, told his nation: ""We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. This enemy can be deadly, but it is beatable."" US President Donald Trump, once he had finished declaring criticism of his response to the pandemic a hoax, described himself as ""a wartime President"". Elevating his verbosity to the realm of battle with a foreign power, he spoke of ""our war against the Chinese virus"", which he now calls ""the invisible enemy"". Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison tried his hand at the military metaphor, too. ""We will respond to this challenge, and we are up to the fight,"" he declared earlier this month. ""We will pay the price needed to protect our sovereignty and we will chart our way out."" The cemetery at Shrapnel Valley on the Gallipoli Peninsula, empty of visitors this year. Credit:TJ (Ilhami Gezici) To do the charting, the national cabinet — combining both Commonwealth and state leaders — was instantly dubbed by commentators a ""war cabinet"". But if this was a new ""war"", Australia and New Zealand, having been granted the time to look at the tragic happenings in China, other parts of Asia, across Europe and latterly America, would plot their own strategies. For the first time in more than a century, Anzacs would not blindly plunge off in the wake of the great powers, as they had in World War I at the call of the British Empire, expending their youth in Gallipoli and on the Western Front. Nor, having seen chaos unfold in Trump’s effectively leaderless America, would they be led by the United States, as they had been from Vietnam to Afghanistan and Iraq in the hope that Washington would come to our defence if required, just as it had during World War II. Australia and New Zealand, each blessedly at a distance from the initial spread of the virus and able to close their national borders, had time to draw lessons from the disaster that overtook nations like Italy. If there ever was a case for employing the imagery of war, it came early from a leading doctor from the Lombardy region of Italy, Saverio Chiaravalle, engulfed in anguish at the death of fellow doctors: ""They died on the field, but when you are in combat, you don’t imagine it could happen to you. The enemy is invisible, but this is like a war."" Australia’s leaders, sensibly, soon enough dropped reliance on military rhetoric and handed responsibility for both planning and explanation to serious and believable medical officers. Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy, and his state colleagues became the unflappable civilian faces of the nation’s nightly bulletins, laying out the perils and radiating the hope that distancing behaviour — whatever the sacrifice it might ask — would pay dividends in ""flattening the curve"". Among those sacrifices could be found a rough parallel between today’s restrictions on grieving and those of World War I. Today, just 10 people may attend a funeral, leading many families to decide that proper farewells would occur some time in the future. In the 1914-1918 war, no bodies came home from the battlefields, leaving towns everywhere to compensate by building cenotaphs. Happily, with the spread of the virus apparently faltering, the steady approach of Australia and New Zealand appears to be working. The sober and scientific explanations of the medical officers place no store in comparisons between the pandemic and warfare, knowing such linkages wouldn’t hold up to scrutiny. War is the ultimate act of violence between humans, requiring governments to pay vast sums to equip defence forces with the means to kill opposing armies. In the current crisis, governments are paying vast sums to give their citizens the means to save themselves by retreating behind closed doors. It is an ultimate act of welfare. War is fought side by side, soldiers battling together. Social isolation, in contrast, is the awkward language of the current struggle, just as it was during the Spanish flu pandemic that swept the world on the heels of World War I. Now, as then, we keep our distance. Children wave through closed glass to grandparents locked in their homes. The generous deliver aid packages to porches, knock on the door and walk quickly away. In World War II prisoner-of-war camps, men promised mates they would never be allowed to die lonely, and held them until the end. Now, patients die of COVID-19 with no one but a nurse — likely a stranger, however caring — to witness their passing. War swallows the lives of the most vigorous. The novel coronavirus kills, in the main, the old and those whose immune systems are compromised. Why then, would leaders of nations use the language of war for such an emergency? ""It’s the least surprising thing in the world that politicians will embrace the language of war if they can find an opportunity to do it,"" says Hugh White, Emeritus Professor of Strategic Studies at the Australian National University. White, who worked as a senior adviser to Labor defence minister Kim Beazley and prime minister Bob Hawke, and served as deputy secretary in the Department of Defence when John Howard was prime minister, has seen up close Australian politicians transform themselves and their political fortunes through militaristic decision-making.

Credit:Alex Ellinghausen ""We no longer judge them on their managerial competence, but on their strength. It is as if we want leaders who will pick up their broadsword and run at the enemy."" But embracing conflict regularly proves counter-productive in the longer term, White notes. The military response to the criminal attacks of September 11, 2001, ended up destabilising much of the Middle East. Trump’s current belligerence towards China, using the genesis of the coronavirus as his excuse, risks unleashing trade, diplomatic and even military consequences that could destabilise our region. The ripple effect already reaches far: Asian Australians have been beaten and vilified in our streets. Meanwhile, a plague slips through communities across the continents, untroubled by bold words, starved of victims only by the distances placed between citizens on the advice of level-headed experts who, unlike warrior leaders, counsel isolation.

On the morning of April 10, 1912, Johannes Vogelin set sail on his second cruise on an ocean liner - the RMS Titanic. Five days later, on this its maiden voyage, it hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic off the coast of Newfoundland and sank to the bottom of the ocean. Of more than 2200 crew and passengers, nearly 1500 perished. December 5, 1970: Ernest William ""Bluey"" and Johanna McGann with their five daughters (left to right, ascending in age) Betty, Pat, Norma, Phyllis and Joan, on the wedding day of Norma's daughter. 
 Johannes was one of them. His body was never recovered. Bluey and Johanna married in London in 1918. Bluey gave her a ring that had caught his eye in Egypt on his way to Turkey. It had a large dome-shaped light blue setting that when held to the light revealed a profile of the Virgin Mary in a veil. The couple sailed for Australia and settled at Murrumburrah, part of the twin town with Harden in NSW. They had five daughters. Bluey first worked with the railways but left when his hand was caught in a carriage coupling, severing three fingers. Despite that handicap he followed a family tradition and opened a bootmaker's shop in his front room. His dexterity with thumb and index finger was legendary. Johanna’s sister, Lina, died childless in England in 1966, leaving her sister £25,000 (about $890,000 in today's money). Bluey and Jo in 1970. Ernest William McGann and Johanna Vogelin had been married for 55 years when Bluey died of dementia in 1973. Johanna died in Queanbeyan in 1978. A lot of history died with them.

That way, if one lab worker gets exposed to the virus, forcing colleagues into quarantine, the other group can step in unaffected. Senior Hospital Scientist Anna Condylios  at work in the lab of the Prince of Wales Hospital.Credit:Kate Geraghty The workload has been intense. This facility alone was running 2500 COVID-19 tests a day when transmission rates were at their peak. Senior medical virologist and director of the lab, Professor Bill Rawlinson, sounds almost affectionate when he talks of the machines and their ""workhorse"" capacity. But while rate of testing hasn’t abated – indeed NSW is now ramping up to 8000 tests a day – the number of positive results has fallen dramatically. Nationally, Australia had only 13 new cases in the 24 hours until early Friday morning, for a cumulative total of 6667 cases, with fewer than 80 deaths. It's a stunning achievement. Experts are wondering if we’ve pulled off a miracle. The talk is not just of suppression of the virus, but possible elimination of the scourge of COVID-19 altogether from parts of the country. Internationally, we have become part of a small and fortunate club – including New Zealand, Germany and Norway – where suppression has worked so well governments are looking for ways to take their foot off the brake, to ease the burden of lockdowns on their communities and their economies. This week, the national cabinet of federal and state leaders flagged small but sentinel steps towards that goal. Some categories of elective surgery are to be resumed in hospitals. Sydney’s most famous eastern suburbs beaches were partially reopened for swimming and surfing. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has floated the idea of allowing travel between Australia and New Zealand. In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian wants students gradually returning to their classrooms from May 11, though in Victoria the preference remains for home-schooling. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt described the elective surgery decision as a ""very important day on the road back"" even as he and Morrison warned remaining strictures would stay in place for at least the next three weeks. Morrison has laid down several markers for easing social distancing measures. These include keeping the transmission rate for COVID-19 below one for each person infected (currently the case for all states except Tasmania), broadening testing capacity, building up ""industrial scale"" contact-tracing and having swift response plans for outbreaks. On Friday, the national cabinet unveiled an even more ambitious testing program as part of what Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy called a ""pandemic intelligence plan"", looking to expand tests to include asymptomatic people in a range of front-line occupations. ""We want to be testing 40,000, 50,000 Australians a day if necessary"", he said. The lessons of Singapore and Tasmania are stark reminders of how quickly the virus can flare, warns Monash University’s Professor Allen Cheng, who sits on the peak Australian Health Protection Principal Committee which advises the national cabinet. Singapore was initially held up as a shining example of how to contain the virus, but disease is now running rampant through migrant worker dorms. In Tasmania, despite the island sealing its borders against the mainland, a hospital outbreak most likely linked to a returning Ruby Princess passenger plunged thousands into lockdown in the state’s north-west. Replay   Cheng says it’s a reminder to keep a lookout for where our exposed ""underbelly"" might be. ""Have we addressed all our vulnerabilities, things like remote Indigenous communities, or asylum seeker detention facilities,"" he challenges. ""We need to get [extra measures] in place so that if we relax, and something happens in some of these settings, we know how to respond really quickly to get on top of it … It only takes one slip-up or chance event, and things can fall apart very quickly."" Prisons and aged care homes are also potential Achilles heels. Yet like many other public health experts, Cheng is sensitive to the pressure for easing strictures. ""We don't want to do more than we need to,"" he says. ""All the public health people understand that having millions of people out of work is not good for [community] health or anything else. Everyone feels that pressure."" Tellingly, one of the nation’s top modellers, Professor Jodie McVernon of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, found herself challenged on ABC TV’s Q+A this week about whether early and much more pessimistic modelling of the disease’s progression in Australia had been wrong. No, she shot back. The models had not been wrong. They had helped avert the horrors of makeshift morgues in the back of refrigerated trucks because ""our government listened to these predictions at a time when many others didn’t, and that is why Australia has not had go to through that"". Berejiklian warned on Friday that case numbers would inevitably begin climbing again once people started mixing more freely. So too would hospital admissions for the virus. She has urged everyone in the state with even the mildest of symptoms to present for a test. Victoria is doing the same. But the national cabinet decision on Friday will mean the net is now cast even wider – in what is called ""sentinel testing"" – to include categories of people who might be flashing no warning light for infection at all. Senior Hospital Scientist Vidiya Ramachandran with a coronavirus sample in the Virology Laboratory at the Prince of Wales Hospital.Credit:Kate Geraghty Another key part of broad surveillance plans will be serological surveys, broad-scale blood testing to determine how far the virus has made its way silently through the broader community. The first results from serosurveys in New York this week suggested as many as 2.7 million New Yorkers could have picked up the virus, vastly more than limited case testing has revealed. Serosurveys detect antibodies, the defences manufactured by our bodies against viral invaders. They are particularly useful for identifying people who may never have fallen ill yet still, at some point in the past, became infected. The Doherty Institute’s Professor Deborah Williamson says serology is still ""finding its way"" in the battle against COVID-19 but predicts it will be ""paramount"" in getting a more accurate picture of the extent of infection in the community. That, in turn, will help shape decisions about negotiating the path out of lockdown. Two leading epidemiologists, Professor John Kaldor of the Kirby Institute in Sydney, and Professor Kristine Macartney, of Westmead’s National Centre For Immunisation Research and Surveillance, have now won funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council to start designing Australia's first COVID-19 serosurvey. ""The key issue to be decided is which populations and which tests,"" Kaldor says. ""The most important thing is to set up a mechanism that is repeatable, so it can track changes in the community."" The work will involve looking for relevant antibodies in tens of thousands of Australians over the long term. ""We know that a substantial proportion of people, particularly among the young, don't have symptoms and may never know they had the infection."" The survey will explore that story as well as indicate what proportion of the population might have acquired some immunity – though right now no-one is sure how much immunity COVID-19 antibodies bestow, or for how long. Federal Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says serology tests would start ""pretty soon but I can’t put a date on it"". The serosurvey strategy would have to be large and representative of the national population, he adds. The researchers could test blood bank donations, or piggyback routine blood tests. GP clinics or shopping centres were other options, but Kelly says the most obvious sites for serosurveys were the COVID fever clinics already performing PCR [nose and throat] swab tests across the country. ""It’s premature to speculate,"" Kelly says. ""We’ll have those discussions in coming weeks."" An even greater challenge is settling on which test to use. Many are now flooding onto the market, but have a propensity for yielding false positives which can distort the true rate of underlying infection. ""Antibody tests have a false positivity rate in this area, often of 1, 2 or 3 per cent,"" says Professor Brendan Crabb, director of Melbourne's Burnet Institute. ""That doesn't sound very much, but ... if you do a sero-prevalence survey with an error rate of 1 per cent and your [infection] prevalence rate is 0.1 per cent, you may be wrong nine out of 10 times."" Sanjay Adhikari delivers samples that are to be tested for coronavirus at the Prince of Wales Hospital.  Credit:Kate Geraghty One reason for false positives is when tests cross-react to antibodies generated by more common coronaviruses and not just COVID-19. Kelly says two laboratories, one at Westmead in Sydney and another at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, are now running quality-control experiments for the government. Crabb says the Burnet institute is working on its own antibody test but he’s confident that ""whether it is our [test] or someone else’s, in the next few weeks the country will have a really good sense of what we can use for which purpose, and what we can’t"". The ""when"" to ease social controls is not about picking a specific date, he says. It’s ""when mechanisms are in place to track the virus in the community. Let’s hope that is one week away but it could be much longer than three weeks."" The federal government is urging millions of Australians to download the voluntary app that will warn people when they've been in close proximity to a known COVID-19 case. Other European countries are venturing down this road as well, following in Singapore’s footsteps. In Norway they call it ""Smittestop"" – contagion stop. Privacy advocates remain worried about the temptation to turn the app to other purposes. Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter has announced he will regulate to ensure law enforcement agencies are not able to access the data it generates. Cheng sees the app as a necessary trade-off for relaxing some of the lockdown measures. ""The thinking behind the app is to build up contact tracing,"" he says. ""We have to do even better at that if we are going to relax something else."" In NSW, the marshalling of data to fight COVID-19 has another enthusiastic proponent in Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello. He recounted this week how he had called together top information officers from all major departments just two days after the State Emergency Operations Centre was stood up, ordering them to pool information to respond to the pandemic. ""All the major [data] dashboards from [departments] have now been drawn into one place,"" he says. The state Data Analytics Centre, which he set up five years ago, is using aggregated and anonymised data from a wide range of state agencies as well as from banks, telcos, Google and Apple to produce what he calls ""mobility tracking"". Credit card information supplied by banks, for instance, can reveal whether people are spending in their neighbourhood, or 20 kilometres from home. ""If there are lot of people in a given suburb moving around, that speaks to a higher risk of transmission,"" Dominello says. ""The health data is telling you whether there is a hotspot, but these other systems become relevant for telling you why a hotspot has developed."" Or, indeed, where another might spring up. Dominello has adopted the North American terminology of the ""hammer and dance"" to describe how the virus might be managed with localised lockdowns, should outbreaks occur once social distancing measures are relaxed. ""You dance with the virus while it is in a suppressed state,"" he says, ""but if it pops its head up, you hammer it down .. you have to do it fast, you have to do it hard, and you have to do it local."" Not using data in this way, he insists, is akin to undertaking surgery blindfolded. ""We have got to start building this into future planning because to suggest there is not going to be a COVID-22 or a COVID-24, or whatever, is just reckless."" Brendan Crabb is still scratching his head over why Australia, thus far, has enjoyed such relative success. ""We acted very early on our borders, that was good,"" he says. ""Then we acted fast enough on our lockdown - two weeks later, and we don't know what would have happened. However there may also have been something else we don’t know about yet, about Australia and New Zealand. Is it because we are islands? Is it because we have fairly sparse populations? We don’t know. But I suspect there is a third reason that one day will become a bit clearer as to why in this early stage we have been so successful."" Professor Bill Rawlinson at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Sydney. Credit:Kate Geraghty Bill Rawlinson, surveying his domain at the Prince of Wales lab, is phlegmatic. ""As a virologist, I know there will be another pandemic,"" he says. He starts to quote Tommy Lee Jones’ Agent K from the film Men In Black. ""‘There is always an Arquillian Battle Cruiser, or a Corillian Death Ray, or an intergalactic plague that is about to wipe out all life on this miserable little planet, and the only way … people can get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it.’ ""Something else will come after this,"" he adds. It may be an isolated outbreak that affects a handful of people, it might be something worse. ""But the point is these things always come along.

13,/national/covid-19-testing-for-healthy-frontline-workers-on-the-national-agenda-20200424-p54mwh.html,COVID-19 testing for healthy front-line workers on the national agenda,"The national cabinet is considering expanding coronavirus testing for the first time to asymptomatic front-line workers, including police, retail staff and transport workers. On Friday NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a statewide testing blitz, expanding the criteria to anyone with even the mildest symptoms, in line with every state and territory. Replay   The national death toll rose by two to 78 on Friday, with the death of a 79-year-old Tasmanian woman linked to an outbreak of cases in the state's north-west and the death in Western Australia of a German man in his 70s who had been a passenger on the cruise ship Artania. In a move designed to mop up undetected cases outside hotspot suburbs, Ms Berejiklian announced NSW was aiming to double its testing capacity to 8000 per day and urged anyone with a fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat or shortness of breath to get tested. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly said the national cabinet was contemplating going one major step further - testing large groups of people with no symptoms. ""It could be for example related to professions that have a lot of interaction with the community because of the nature of their profession they don't adhere to the 1.5 metre rule,"" he told The Sydney Morning Herald. ""You can imagine front-line workers. We are already doing that with healthcare and aged care workers, but any professions where they have a lot of interaction with a lot of people during the day."" The most likely candidates would be the same professions protected by the expansion of NSW’s $5000 fine for spitting or coughing on front-line staff to not only protect healthcare workers and police, but grocery check-out staff, bus drivers and other retail or transport workers. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy confirmed this type of ""active surveillance"" was being considered. ""National cabinet is very clear that they want to be absolutely confident before relaxing any measures that we are in a position in this country to detect any community transmission of any significance,"" Professor Murphy said. The aim would be to detect individuals who are infected - and potentially shedding the virus - but do not have symptoms. Professor Kelly said: ""This is very much about us taking the test to people rather than people coming to us for the test."" How this would be done is under discussion, he said. With fewer than 200 new confirmed cases this week, Australia is on track to ease restrictions in line with Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s four-week deadline announced last week, Professor Kelly said.

On Friday NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a statewide testing blitz, expanding the criteria to anyone with even the mildest symptoms, in line with every state and territory. Replay   The national death toll rose by two to 78 on Friday, with the death of a 79-year-old Tasmanian woman linked to an outbreak of cases in the state's north-west and the death in Western Australia of a German man in his 70s who had been a passenger on the cruise ship Artania. In a move designed to mop up undetected cases outside hotspot suburbs, Ms Berejiklian announced NSW was aiming to double its testing capacity to 8000 per day and urged anyone with a fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat or shortness of breath to get tested. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly said the national cabinet was contemplating going one major step further - testing large groups of people with no symptoms.

15,/national/lunch-with-raina-macintyre-cautious-coronavirus-communicator-20200420-p54li5.html,Lunch with Raina MacIntyre: cautious coronavirus communicator,"Professor Raina MacIntyre, one of the world's leading emerging infectious diseases experts has barely budged from the bedroom of her Wahroonga home since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Australia. The globally-renowned epidemiologist's clear-yet-cautious tone has made her a familiar face and voice on most things coronavirus related on television and radio: all calmly delivered from her bedroom, where she continues her research almost around the clock. Occasionally, she sleeps there too. Raina MacIntyre on the balcony of her Wahroonga home. Her approach is always ""prepare for the worst, hope for the best"".
Credit:James Brickwood Each day she rises between 4 and 5 am, takes her three dogs - a Doberman, a bull arab and a greyhound shepherd cross - for a quick walk, then is back at her desk with strong coffee and hundreds of emails. She spent this past Tuesday, her 56th birthday, giving an online lecture from home on what she calls the herd immunity ""myth"" and why she does not see it as an exit strategy from this global health crisis. She hasn't been to her office on the Kensington campus of the University of NSW – where she is head of the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute – since early March. Nor has she been to the supermarket. So when it comes to having lunch via zoom in our respective homes, the food options are limited. She'd prefer to cook than have takeaway brought to the house so it's either reheating a Coles frozen dinner or leftovers from Easter Sunday. We both opt for leftovers. Hers, a traditional festive food from her native Sri Lanka: chicken with coconut milk rice served in cubes with condiments, which she cooked on her first day off since the outbreak began. Mine a one-pot Portuguese dish known affectionately in our family as Grandpa Joe's chicken. Apologies readers, there are no receipts. Her university-aged children, daughter, 20 and son, 18, do the once-a-month supermarket shop and it's so long ago dockets can't be found. Raina MacIntyre's home-cooked Sri Lankan chicken with coconut milk rice.Credit:Raina MacIntyre Professor MacIntyre's medical research focuses on respiratory transmissible viral infections. Professionally, she uses tools like epidemiological and mathematical modelling and contact tracing to chart this virus, and has led the world's largest body of international clinical research on face masks and respirators. But it's equally instructive to see the personal precautions Professor MacIntyre, a pandemic preparedness expert takes in daily life. When our photographer arrives to take a shot of her from afar, she's wearing a surgical face mask (she removes it for the photo – more on face masks later.) Last year her parents, now both in their mid-80s, moved into her home, which precipitated the move from her study into the bedroom to work. She is extremely prudent when it comes to their care. She washes all fruit and vegetables in soapy water if they are to be eaten raw. Her pantry is stocked with tinned goods. The bathroom has plenty of toilet paper, she assures me. ""When I realised what direction things were going and that staying at home was going to be a likely requirement, I did a big shop early and so now we are trying to make do with what we've got. We obviously wouldn't have fresh fruit and vegetables, but we could survive for a couple of months more, we have everything we need,” she says. Replay    ""I think I've been a prepper for a number of years now. Through my work in bioterrorism … I suppose I've been aware of all the different and serious existential threats to society … And I don't have an overly optimistic view of humankind and where we're heading.” Given her understanding of some of the world's deadliest new diseases SARS, MERS, avian bird flu and Ebola, her approach is always prepare for the worst, hope for the best. ""In the short to medium to long term – say six to 18 months – it now looks that we're going to be facing some degree of restriction in lives until we can get a vaccine. It doesn't need to be highly- effective. I think a vaccine that's about 60 per cent effective would do the trick, and it may end up being a vaccine where you need boosters. But until then, really we're in a no-win situation.” MacIntyre was born in Colombo in 1964, and migrated to Australia with her ethnic Tamil family in 1973 at the age of nine. Her scientist uncle Ron Mather, who migrated here in the 1960s and worked at the University of NSW in earth sciences, sponsored them. Her mother Nalini was a teacher and her father Ernest worked in insurance. They settled near her uncle in Woollahra, in a two-bedroom apartment where she shared a room and bunk beds with her older brother who is now a lawyer. Their father had been one of the leading English language playwrights in Sri Lanka. ""When we got here my father joined an Aboriginal theatre group. They were the only people who welcomed him in. He couldn't get into any white theatre group … I wouldn't say Australia was that multicultural then. I mean, there were very few non-white people at the school I went to. I think there was a lot of racism at that time,” she says. Their early life was spent at barbecues and picnics with Indigenous actors like Bob Maza (father to actress Rachael) and Justine Saunders. Their Anglo last name dates back four generations, when she believes her great-great-grandfather converted to Christianity, and took the name of the missionary who converted him: MacIntyre. From Woollahra Public, where she spent her two final years of primary school, she went onto the selective Sydney Girls' High where she toyed with becoming a policewoman. Then, in her final year, she decided to become an artist. ""At the last minute I changed my mind because I didn't think I could make a living from it. I was interested in science in general and medicine just seemed like it had more potential to be actually doing people-centred things,” she says. She went to the University of Sydney to study medicine with a focus on public health, then undertook a masters in applied epidemiology at the Australian National University, based on the US Epidemic Intelligence Service teaching. This training she says was life changing. ""It equips you to be able to go out in the field and investigate an outbreak and figure out what's causing it, how to control it. It's a very specific science … It's a bit like detective work. We don't have the answers when you go out into the field and you collect evidence and information, put it together, analyse it and get the answers that you need to be able to control the epidemic. Shoe-leather epidemiology.” The director of that program, Australian epidemiologist Aileen Plant, who had been involved in the original severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Hanoi, became her mentor. Plant went to Vietnam to take over from Carlo Urbani, the Italian epidemiologist who was the first to identify SARS and then died of it in 2003. Before Plant's sudden death in 2007, MacIntyre did a PhD under her supervision. This led to her gaining a Harkness Fellowship to study at Johns Hopkins University, the gold standard globally for public health research. Here she studied the transmission of tuberculosis in the Maryland prison system. Her findings: the more crowded the environment, the higher the risk of infection, remain in the major infectious disease textbooks. At Sydney Girls' High, MacIntyre is in the bottom row, second from left. During the course of our lunch – MacIntyre's computer pings constantly – typically with questions from healthcare workers from around the world about personal protection equipment – PPE. On this she is adamant – if a healthcare worker does not have PPE they should not be working with COVID-19 affected patients. ""With emerging infections there is no drug or vaccine – all you've got is non-pharmaceutical methods to control them– so the first people at the healthcare frontline are the ones most at risk of getting infected, they are the people we need to protect the most,"" she says. Raina MacIntyre as a medical student in 1984. On the issue of masks, while they're recommending wearing them in the United States in public, she's not recommending it in Australia yet. ""We don't want to use up all the limited stocks of surgical or respirator masks. Because the healthcare workers need them. But in public you could wear a cloth mask if you're living in a heavily-affected suburb. In the hotspots you could certainly consider it even if you're well,"" she says. ""It's important to remember most transmissions actually happen in the household. A study in China showed that 70 per cent of all the inflections came in the household, so it is the household context where we are most are at risk."" While she eats her delicious-looking meal, licking her well-washed fingers, mine has gone cold. In a sense, her life's work has been about preparing. Last year she was preparing for a bushfire (the whole family-of-five had to be evacuated in November when a bushfire at nearby Turramurra came close to their home). She installed a fire-proof safe, then went back to her studies on pandemic preparedness. It's not a good feeling what she's been prepping for has actually come to pass. ""I have been one of the many saying look, these are the preparations we need for a pandemic. Hopefully some of what I say has influenced the direction we've gone in. I've certainly sent unsolicited advice and my thoughts to government officials, and it's been well received. There's a feeling you're putting your neck on the line sometimes with politicians and like you're not feeling listened to. But I'm feeling listened to now,"" she says. Michael Kirby, the patron of the Kirby Institute which was founded in 1986 to study infectious diseases related to AIDS/HIV, believes MacIntyre is listened to because she has the skill to explain complex virology in everyday language. ""Her high intelligence shines through ... but so does her human empathy,"" he told me before our lunch. Some of this is to do with her faith. Although she was raised an Anglican, she is a practising Catholic. So as well as ""zooming"" with absent family members, including her ex-husband –with whom she and her children are still close – she also watched the Easter Sunday service streamed from her local Catholic church. Raina MacIntyre as an extra in Midsummer Night's Dream with Opera Australia. The ritual comforts her. She loves the drama of opera too, and was once an extra in Opera Australia's Midsummer Night's Dream, as hand maid to Titania, played by Dame Joan Sutherland. Although she says she's quite self-contained, she does miss taking the dogs for longer walks, and the citizen science project she was involved with, documenting bush turkeys in her neighbourhood. She's noticed lots more bird life during this period of enforced rest for the Earth. But until there's a vaccine, she won't be resting anytime soon.

The federal government is pursuing a strategy of virus suppression, but as the numbers of new daily cases continue to fall, elimination seems increasingly enticing to many. Nursing homes pose one of the greatest risks to eradicating coronavirus in Australia, experts say.  Credit:Louise Kennerley Melbourne University epidemiologists Dr Kathryn Snow and Professor James McCaw warned against complacency and the misplaced belief that eradication was inevitable. Dr Snow said there was a misplaced sense in the community that “we are pretty much out of the woods”. But Australia could have large outbreaks even under the present level of social distancing measures, she said. There is a chance we could eliminate the virus “but there is a huge element of luck in this”. “Right now we are seeing very low numbers of new cases. [But] if COVID gets into a prison in Australia that will change very rapidly,” Dr Snow said. “There are many many people who have to go in and out of a prison every day because that is where they work. “We are very fortunate in Australia that it hasn’t gotten into very many nursing homes. But it could. Because people have to go in and out of nursing homes, because they have to go to work and they have to provide care to people.” Replay   Immigration detention centres were also high-risk environments. “The physical structure of prisons and immigration detention centres and the way they operate make infection control very difficult,” she said, much like separating people in a nursing home. Dr Snow stressed these were not populations completely cut off from the rest of society. “People imagine that a prison is a completely self-contained environment … and it doesn't affect the rest of us but it absolutely does. “Staff go in and out of prisons every day and they go home to their families and people in prison move in and out. The average amount of time that people spend in a prison is only in the order of weeks. “They are not a contained environment that we don’t have to worry about. They are part of our society … they contain many of the most vulnerable people in our society,” she said. She compared an epidemic to the randomness and unpredictability of a bushfire. “We could get lucky and eradicate the virus, but we could also get unlucky and see large outbreaks. “We are not guaranteed any particular outcome with any particular restriction.” Professor James McCaw – one of the government’s pandemic modellers – said Australia had a chance of eradicating the virus if the reproductive number stayed below one for long enough (which assumes at a population level every one person infected will transmit the virus to fewer than one person, starving the virus of hosts) and the borders remained closed. “But ‘should we?’ is a much harder question to answer,” Professor McCaw said. He said it would be an incredibly long and costly process, and any easing of restrictions would jeopardise the chances of elimination. The biggest concern was that the virus would be re-imported, he said. “Australia has the advantage of being an island, but we don’t have an impenetrable border. Mistakes or malicious activity would be guaranteed,” Professor McCaw said. We would need a surveillance system capable of picking up these “inevitable importations” quickly. In practice, Dr McCaw said, suppression and eradication measures look very similar. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stipulated any move to ease restrictions is contingent on the implementation of widespread and rapid testing, ""industrial capacity"" contact tracing, and the ability to contain clusters fast.

There is a chance we could eliminate the virus “but there is a huge element of luck in this”. “Right now we are seeing very low numbers of new cases. [But] if COVID gets into a prison in Australia that will change very rapidly,” Dr Snow said. “There are many many people who have to go in and out of a prison every day because that is where they work. “We are very fortunate in Australia that it hasn’t gotten into very many nursing homes. But it could. Because people have to go in and out of nursing homes, because they have to go to work and they have to provide care to people.” Replay   Immigration detention centres were also high-risk environments. “The physical structure of prisons and immigration detention centres and the way they operate make infection control very difficult,” she said, much like separating people in a nursing home. Dr Snow stressed these were not populations completely cut off from the rest of society. “People imagine that a prison is a completely self-contained environment … and it doesn't affect the rest of us but it absolutely does. “Staff go in and out of prisons every day and they go home to their families and people in prison move in and out. The average amount of time that people spend in a prison is only in the order of weeks. “They are not a contained environment that we don’t have to worry about. They are part of our society … they contain many of the most vulnerable people in our society,” she said. She compared an epidemic to the randomness and unpredictability of a bushfire. “We could get lucky and eradicate the virus, but we could also get unlucky and see large outbreaks. “We are not guaranteed any particular outcome with any particular restriction.” Professor James McCaw – one of the government’s pandemic modellers – said Australia had a chance of eradicating the virus if the reproductive number stayed below one for long enough (which assumes at a population level every one person infected will transmit the virus to fewer than one person, starving the virus of hosts) and the borders remained closed. “But ‘should we?’ is a much harder question to answer,” Professor McCaw said. He said it would be an incredibly long and costly process, and any easing of restrictions would jeopardise the chances of elimination. The biggest concern was that the virus would be re-imported, he said. “Australia has the advantage of being an island, but we don’t have an impenetrable border. Mistakes or malicious activity would be guaranteed,” Professor McCaw said. We would need a surveillance system capable of picking up these “inevitable importations” quickly. In practice, Dr McCaw said, suppression and eradication measures look very similar. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stipulated any move to ease restrictions is contingent on the implementation of widespread and rapid testing, ""industrial capacity"" contact tracing, and the ability to contain clusters fast.

19,/national/the-coronavirus-has-altered-what-australians-worry-about-most-20200415-p54k5q.html,The coronavirus has altered what Australians worry about most,"The coronavirus pandemic has dramatically altered what Australians worry about most as anxiety about health and job security surges to record highs and concern about the environment wanes. The monthly Ipsos Issues Monitor, which asks a representative sample of the population to identify the three most important issues facing the nation, shows healthcare has emerged as the biggest national concern in the wake of the epidemic. The mass job losses caused by the coronavirus-induced downturn have also stoked fears about unemployment. Unemployment has emerged as one of our biggest worries since the coronavirus outbreak.Credit:Janie Barrett A record 55 per cent of respondents identified healthcare as a top concern in April, up from 33 per cent a month earlier. Next highest was the state of the economy (47 per cent). But the most dramatic increase was in the share of respondents ranking unemployment among their biggest worries. That more than doubled from 16 per cent to 39 per cent, easily the highest in the decade-long history of the survey. The previous record was 33 per cent in August of 2014 when the national unemployment rate was 6.2 per cent. The results are a striking turnaround compared with the first two months of this year when the state of the environment was clearly the nation’s biggest worry. In January, amid the bushfire crisis and prolonged drought, a record 41 per cent nominated the environment as a top concern. But that share fell to 22 per cent this month. Anxiety about crime, the cost of living, and housing affordability – all prominent community concerns in recent years – have also declined markedly. The share of respondents nominating crime as a top concern, for instance, dipped to an all-time low of 13 per cent in April. Ipsos social researcher, David Elliott, said it was very unusual for three separate issues to climb so steeply all at the same time. ""Usually it is just one issue that rises like this,"" he said. ""Multiple concerns are now on the rise."" The survey showed those in younger age groups were more likely to identify unemployment, cost of living pressures and the environment among their primary concerns while older respondents were more likely to cite healthcare and the economy. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Unemployment Expectations Index released on Wednesday underscores the growing anxiety in the community about unemployment. The index, which gauges whether consumers anticipate unemployment to rise in the year ahead, has risen sharply in the past two months and reached a five-year high in April (higher readings show more consumers expect unemployment to rise). Heightened fears about job security can affect activity across the economy by making consumers more cautious about spending, especially on big ticket items. The unemployment rate was 5.1 per cent in February but Treasury modelling released this week showed the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak would lift that figure to around 10 per cent by the middle of the year. Under that scenario the number of people without a job would rise from 700,000 now to around 1.4 million, an all-time high.

21,/national/victoria/gas-fields-seven-times-more-polluting-than-estimate-think-tank-says-20200414-p54ju5.html,"Gas fields seven times more polluting than estimate, think tank says","The true climate impact of new onshore gas exploration and extraction has been underestimated by as much as seven times because the Victorian government excluded emissions produced when the gas is burnt. According to a new briefing paper from policy think tank the Australia Institute, the Andrews government's estimates do not count emissions produced when the gas is burnt for heating, cooking or other end uses. A moratorium on onshore gas exploration in Victoria will be lifted.  Last month's lifting of the long-standing moratorium on onshore exploration was welcomed by gas producers, unions and manufacturers, which had called for it to be abolished, but environment groups remain fiercely opposed, arguing onshore drilling will drive up greenhouse gas emissions. When he announced the lifting of the ban, Premier Daniel Andrews pledged any gas would first be made available to Victorian households and businesses. Mr Andrews said Victoria was ""backing the science"", referring to the government's scientific research program to assess the potential for gas extraction. Under Australia's carbon accounting methodology, emissions are counted where the fossil fuels are burnt, which, since much of our coal and gas is exported, is usually overseas. The most recent report from this research found greenhouse gas emissions from a range of extraction scenarios would produce up to 830 petajoules of gas over 26 years, and create total emissions of 6.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The government's estimates are based only on emissions relating to exploration and extraction, but if the emissions from burning this gas are also included, this figure soars to more than 46 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the Australia Institute found, seven times greater than government estimates. Richie Merzian, the institute's climate and energy director, questioned why carbon dioxide produced when Victorian gas was burnt does not have to be included in emissions calculations. ""The government needs to explain why the advice it used to lift the ban on more gas extraction so badly underestimated the impact this would have on the climate,"" says Mr Merzian. ""Gas is not a transitional fuel in the fight against climate change, it is part of the problem."" While it is standard practice that carbon emissions are counted at the point where they are created rather than where they are burnt, that should not absolve governments from responsibility, says Nicholas Aberle, the campaigns manager at Environment Victoria. ""We can’t pretend that our coal exports have no impact on the climate, and nor should we pretend our extraction of gas might have no impact on the climate regardless of where it is eventually burnt,"" he said. Jaclyn Symes, the Minister for Resources, said the government’s approach had been scrutinised by Victoria’s lead scientist and an independent panel made up of farmers, industry, local government and the community. ""Securing local gas supply for Victorians will not come at the cost of the state’s environment, its groundwater supplies or agricultural industries,"" she said. One week after Victoria announced it would abolish part of its onshore gas-drilling ban in a bid to increase supply, new modelling predicted a 35 per cent drop in production from existing gas fields within five years. The market operator's forecast, which was made before the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic, warns shortfalls could take effect as early as 2023 and could force restricted supplies to some consumers including gas-fired power plants. The decision to lift the moratorium will allow exploration and drilling for gas to commence from the middle of next year. Miki Perkins is a senior journalist and Environment Reporter at The Age.

Drunk on a landscape that has been transformed. Like most of Australia, my beef property here in central Queensland has been in drought for far too long, but in January a strange thing happened – it rained. Now there is grass so iridescent green, it almost blinds, and I am so full of joy, I want to shout from the top of the windmill (which I won’t do because I am a sook when it comes to heights) and tell the world how blessed I am to live in the bush. In a drought, those blessings can be harder to find. Dust storms are relentless. Willy-willies chase the dust (and desiccated cow manure) indoors. Friends clog the aisles in the local supermarket to talk and cry and hug and then return to dry farms and hungry animals. The heat bakes the land and hearts. Feral pigs move in – searching, like all life, for water. A dog dies. Mandy McKeesick's property before and after the rain.Credit:Mandy McKeesick Even in a drought I don’t think of myself as despondent, but in this current euphoric state I can reflect. Maybe that email I sent was abnormally terse. Maybe that phone call was a little callous. Maybe I overreacted to that post on social media. Maybe others saw what I could not. To all those people who saw, I now apologise if I am giddy and over-the-top. Somewhere, sometime I will plateau. I promise. I know the drought is not over. I know we need more rain. I know I have friends who are yet to see any of this miracle stuff that falls from the sky. I know these things, but my joy will not be restrained. I want to take a moment to be truly grateful for this rare and precious gift. The first rain came in January, swift and angry, sending water running over parched paddocks. The back dam, the day before barely large enough to float a duck, swelled. The lagoon started to fill. The creek, having been reduced to one shrinking, stinking, boggy hole, flowed and if you took the time, you could hear the red gums sucking up the water. But the frogs were silent. There is a patch of land below my house that I optimistically refer to as the wetlands. Usually after good rain, it is a riot of cacophonous frogs. But not this time. The water had run too swift and angry to penetrate the long-dry soil. I may not believe in the weatherman, but I believe in nature and I trust in frogs. I may not believe in the weatherman, but I believe in nature and I trust in frogs. The second rain came in February, of a similar amount, but this time soft and soaking. It took 48 hours but the frogs awakened – and only frogsong comes close to the sound of rain. Small brown frogs have taken up residence in the bathroom. Green tree frogs under the tank stand call to the one in the bedroom air conditioner – who shares lodgings with a gecko with irritatingly regular bowel movements. Snakes have taken up residence with the dogs – a python by Bonnie and six pieces of brown snake in Manu’s run. A hundred million biting mozzies want to feast on my blood. The cows are picking up. Their coats shine and they run and buck and fart and gallop through grass growing ahead of them. The camels have shed their winter coats and once again look majestic standing on a green ridge silhouetted by blue-black storm clouds. The dogs are grinning. Last year, a 12-kilometre lap around the farm was an arduous hot and dry ordeal. Now they climb out of a trough and splash into the lagoon, swim across the creek and race each other madly through puddles in paddocks. To live by nature is to live by her rules and her extremes. Each day brings new delights. Wildflowers (or weeds, depending on your point of view) dot-paint the land in purple and yellow as they begin the colonisation and repair of the soil. Pasture grasses thrive. Cuddles the koala reverse-parks into a fork of a poplar box. The rainwater tank overflows. I can even get partially excited about the novelty of mowing the lawn until I look at the mower, used once last year, with its flat tyres and flat battery, and consider just opening the gate for the cattle. And whenever I think that intoxication may be waning, I walk past a myrtle tree in full flower, the scent heavy and heady, and once again I am hopelessly infatuated with this country. To live by nature is to live by her rules and her extremes. This rain has transformed the landscape and it has transformed the minds of rural people, although without further prolonged rain we will quickly sober up and face our hangovers. We have a new problem in our collective midst, too, in the form of coronavirus. But this is a start. This is a glorious, bountiful, beautiful reminder of why I love rural Australia.

Many parts of the state are expecting rain and thunderstorms over the next eight days, with some areas set to collect up to 100 millimetres. A rain band moves across an increasingly locked down Sydney in Newport on Monday.Credit:Nick Moir From 9am on Sunday until 9am on Monday, parts of inland NSW, including the Central Tablelands and Central West regions, had up to 30 millimetres, while areas of the Hunter region recorded 18mm. By comparison, Sydney Olympic Park recorded the highest rainfall across the city at 5.2mm. While inland regions may move closer to being able to shed their drought-declared status and start planting winter crops in earnest, the Rural Fire Service is watching the forecast with some concern. The RFS and other fire agencies typically do the bulk of any hazard-reduction burning during the period from about mid-March until the end of May when conditions turn too wet. The NSW fires started in July last year, destroying 5.5 million hectares and thousands of houses, and killing 25 people. The eight-day rainfall map shows that some parts of NSW could see as much as 100 millimetres of rain. Credit:BOM The long fire season, which officially ends on Tuesday, has meant many fire crews were exhausted from the long months of battling blazes. With extended rain, the window for controlled burns to limit the fuel load could be delayed further. James Morris, an RFS spokesman, said the coronavirus might also play a role in limiting the ability to conduct such burns. For one thing, crews may be restricted in gathering in appropriate numbers. Secondly, they may need to avoid lighting fires during periods of particularly stable air - otherwise ideal conditions to limit the chance of runaway fires - to prevent large areas such as the Sydney Basin from being blanketed in bushfire smoke. ""We wouldn't want to do anything to cause more damage for those with respiratory issues,"" he said, noting many COVID-19 sufferers might live in the Sydney area. On Tuesday, parts of western Sydney will awake to fog, caused by recent rainfall and cooling temperatures. During the rest of the day there will be light showers and a top of 23 degrees. Thunderstorms are expected to continue across the state for the rest of the week, with an inland trough sitting over western NSW on Wednesday bringing heavier rain on Thursday and Friday. Some parts of the Central West plains are forecast to get up to 100 millimetres. ""Thursday and Friday will still see the rain push towards Sydney.

But advice from the government is that schools are capable of being managed without the 1.5-metre rule in place. Students are encouraged to social distance 1.5 metres as they enter and exit the classroom.Credit:Shutterstock A group of teachers have told WAtoday that correspondence from the Education Department has only added to confusion around how schools would remain safe for staff and students on their return from Wednesday. In an email from Education Director General Lisa Rodgers on Thursday, teachers were told their concerns about social distancing between students were understood, but schools remained safe without the measures. “I understand many of you have concerns and I want to assure you that your safety and wellbeing, alongside our commitment to students, is at the heart of every decision we make,” Ms Rodgers wrote. “All the medical advice I have received tells me that schools are safe and classrooms are capable of being managed without the 1.5m rule in place.” But a document titled Term 2, 2020 Operating Guidelines for Western Australian Public Schools, attached to Ms Rodgers' email, states schools would implement “social distancing measures, encouraging students to maintain 1.5m physical distancing when entering and exiting classrooms”. “Schools should maximise the use of indoor and outdoor spaces to physically distance students where practicable,” the guidelines read. “This may include conducting lessons outdoors or in environments with enhanced ventilation.” With close to full attendance expected at many schools, one teacher told WAtoday social distancing would be a “pipe dream”. In an open letter to the Premier sent to WAtoday from “another undervalued educator”, a high school teacher questioned the issue of adult-to-adult transmission in the community and why year 12 students weren't given the same concern, as they were considered adults by law but heavily encouraged to return to school for face-to-face learning. “Part of our duty of care as teachers, as good human beings even, is to ensure that we are not knowingly putting our students at risk, and yet you want me to put 25 year 12s into a classroom without sufficient social distancing space in direct contravention of safety protocols,” the teacher wrote. “In a school, we have the ability to exercise a high degree of control, but it is nigh-on impossible to stop them from standing close by to their friends at break times. “Short of forcibly telling them where to sit and stand, there is no practical way to enforce this. And if you’re going to enforce this in the yard, why are we not enforcing it in the classroom?” The teacher said teaching students outside was not practical or fair to students. “It’s coming into the colder months and children deserve to be taught in a respectful environment,” they wrote. “Furthermore, there will not be much in the way of meaningful education happening while sitting outside."" Education Minister Sue Ellery on Thursday said schools where possible should increase social distance in accordance with the department’s guidelines. “I know schools are already planning for how they will deal with the return to school and they’re doing it on the basis of those guidelines, but they're also doing it with the knowledge that the risk of transmission is low,” she said. Ms Ellery advised school staff still concerned about social distancing to read WA chief health officer's letter and assess how the state was tracking since early March. “There is no additional risk to students or teachers physically attending school and there has been no student-to-teacher transmission,” she said. “Back in March when they had kids at school, in that last couple of weeks, second last week of March, we were having a reduction in students attending school, it was down around 50 per cent, but still no cases. “If we were going to get cases we were going to get it then. So I ask teachers to consider this if you didn't believe the public health advice at the beginning, please look now at how the results have panned out.” While the number of students returning to schools next week was unavailable, Ms Rodgers said many schools had already surveyed parents to gauge their interest in sending their children to class. Ms Ellery on Friday told Gareth Parker on Radio 6PR's Mornings she expected most students would attend, despite the State School Teachers’ Union of WA encouraging parents to keep their children home. “My sense is that the majority of parents are feeling comfortable about sending their children back to school,” she said. “But I think parents are still going to be considering this over the weekend, and they'll make a decision either way, whatever decision they make their children's education will be supported.” Lauren is WAtoday's education reporter.

The “important message” from the State School Teachers’ Union of WA to parents was delivered in a full-page advertisement in WA’s only daily newspaper on Friday, a day after the union met with Education Minister Sue Ellery. Teachers' union encourage parents to keep their children home. Credit:Gabriele Charotte “Teachers support schools being open from next week for vulnerable students and the children of essential workers – but schools need to be safe,” the ad, endorsed by the union's general secretary Mary Franklin, read. “Support them by keeping your kids home if you can – then we can make schools as safe as possible until we can all be back at school together.” The union acknowledged advice about schools being safe came from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, but said the guidelines could be carried out in schools when there were “limited numbers of students” attending, not when they were full. Teachers spent the last week of term 1 preparing a supply of work for students to be delivered online or in printed packs. Ms Ellery told Gareth Parker on Radio 6PR's Mornings she was disappointed and the advertisement was factually incorrect and “not an accurate description” of the national health advice about social distancing guidelines. “It claims, I think it's trying to describe the 1.5 [metre] distancing thing, for example, as if the advice is global and you have to do it across the entire school in every element of what you're doing, that's not the case,” she said. “The advice has been from the beginning and is now that because of the low risk of transmission schools are safe for staff and students and should stay open.” In response to Ms Ellery's dissappointment, SSTUWA president Pat Byrne issued a statement saying the union's position was ""consistant"" with the state government's approach. “The state government has given parents a choice as to whether to send their kids to school over the next few weeks,” she said. “The newspaper ad placed by the SSTUWA asked parents to exercise their choice to keep their kids home, if they were in a position to do so. “This was to help teachers create the 1.5 metres of physical distancing, which was the advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee at the time (released 16 April).” The advice to parents in the advert comes after the SSTUWA released results of a recent poll that revealed 88 per cent of about 7500 members felt unsafe returning to the classroom. However, despite the concerns for their safety, 77 per cent said they wanted schools to open next week, but the vast majority (71 per cent) preferred schools were only open to some students, including vulnerable students and the children of essential workers. SSTUWA COVID-19 poll surveyed about 7500 of its members. Credit:SSTUWA In a letter to teachers, the state's Chief Health Officer Dr Andy Robertson said although many had experienced heightened levels of stress and anxiety, WA had been spared from widespread disease and schools remained safe. “We have considered the benefits of schools remaining open over the last two months and, in the context of our wider public health strategies, determined schools should stay open and that they are safe for staff and students,” he wrote. “Even when we had higher rates of disease in WA, only 1.5 per cent of cases were in school students (eight cases) and one case was in a teacher, which were mostly related to travel, all of whom had mild illness and have fully recovered. Furthermore, there have been no cases of student-to-student transmission in WA and no cases of student-to-teacher transmission.” In Dr Robertson’s letter to parents, he encouraged families to feel comfortable sending their children to school. “However, if your child has a chronic medical condition or a compromised immune system, you may wish to consult your GP or paediatrician when deciding if your child should return to school,” the letter read. “If your child/children are well, I encourage you to send them back to school this term. If they have symptoms of a cold or have a fever, please keep them at home until they are better. “If you are concerned they may have contracted COVID-19, they can be tested through our COVID clinics or in private collection centres.” Teachers and students will also be able to get tested at school from the second week of term 2 after Health Minister Roger Cook announced on Thursday the asymptomatic testing regime would be expanded to schools. Mr Cook said the Health Department had started looking at different ways to test children so they wouldn’t have to undergo the invasive swab technique, but teachers were the first focus of the study.

It comes amid mounting concern about casual workforces across the state's universities. Western Sydney University has warned staff it will cut casual workloads next semester; Sydney University is slashing 30 per cent of its arts courses; and one-third of casuals at the University of NSW have reported losing work. But it has been unclear if universities would meet the threshold to access JobKeeper, as the federal government on Friday rejected La Trobe University's bid for the subsidy. Sydney University expects a $470 million hit to its bottom line as a result of COVID-19.Credit:Louise Kennerley In an email to staff on Friday, Sydney University vice-chancellor Michael Spence said the university could receive between $100 and $140 million in JobKeeper funding if the majority of eligible staff apply. ""This would be an incredible improvement on our financial situation and would help shape the scale of further savings measures currently being considered,"" he said. La Trobe's vice-chancellor John Dewar initially claimed the university had demonstrated at least 30 per cent reduction in turnover between March 2019 and 2020, and said JobKeeper would allow it to recover $50 million of its $150 million shortfall. But Mr Frydenberg issued a statement saying universities would have to include government funding in their turnover calculations, rejecting La Trobe's apparent rationale that government funding did not count as GST turnover, which is used to assess eligibility. ""Changes will clarify that the core Commonwealth government financial assistance provided to universities will be included in the JobKeeper turnover tests,"" a statement from Mr Frydenberg said. A spokeswoman for La Trobe said the university had acted in good faith and followed the published ATO guidelines. ""We are very disappointed that the application criteria have changed again. JobKeeper was set up to help protect jobs and by moving the goal posts a second time, this will cost jobs in universities,"" the spokeswoman said. Universities face the same requirements as businesses to qualify for JobKeeper. They must demonstrate a 30 per cent turnover decline if their revenue is under $1 billion and 50 per cent if it is above $1 billion. A University of Sydney spokeswoman said the university believed it met relevant criteria regardless of whether it calculated government funding. ""During one of the relevant periods of time, we calculated a revenue reduction of over 50 per cent in our GST turnover, whether or not government grants are included,"" she said. Sydney University expects a shortfall of $470 million this year, due in part to the loss of thousands of full fee-paying Chinese students. WSU vice-chancellor Barney Glover on Thursday told staff that there had been ""a great deal of speculation"" about JobKeeper in the higher education sector. ""Technically we are eligible to apply, but there are tests you have to pass ... The advice we received [is] no Australian university would be likely to pass the threshold,"" he said. At Sydney University, casual and fixed-term staff make up about 60 per cent of the workforce, according to the 2018 annual report. The university says fixed-term and long-term casual staff would be eligible for JobKeeper. Under the scheme, the government would subsidise the university $1500 a fortnight for each eligible staff member. A report compiled by the University of NSW Casuals Network showed that one in three casuals at the university had lost work this month, costing them an average of $626 a week, and 42 per cent were working unpaid hours.

A report compiled by the University of NSW Casuals Network showed that one in three casuals at the university had lost work this month, costing them an average of $626 a week, and 42 per cent were working unpaid hours.

""It arose initially out of my love for English and history and my growing understanding that I could have a great rapport with young people and this was a calling and vocation."" After completing his practical teacher training at Sydney Grammar School when a young Malcolm Turnbull was one of the students, his first teaching job after graduation was at Lurnea High School in Liverpool as an English and history teacher, starting in 1973. The Sydney Grammar experience and his school years at James Ruse High had shown him the heights that gifted students could reach, but he was not prepared for his first job in the public school system. ""I was ill prepared,"" he said. ""I went from experiencing only an elite school to a disadvantaged school in the western suburbs. I went from teaching highly able kids at Sydney Grammar School to an allocation where I had the 13th graded class down in English in Year 9, so it was a rude awakening to the realities of normal teaching. ""I learnt a great deal very quickly. I needed to in order to survive and I had seven wonderful years there. I loved the kids and was sad to eventually leave."" From Lurnea, he went to Leumeah High School in the Campbelltown area before being promoted to  head of history at another western Sydney school, Busby High. He then moved on to Macquarie Fields High, Elderslie High and at the age of 39, became the youngest state high school principal at Thomas Reddall High School in Campbelltown. ""Because I came from a very dysfunctional family myself, I have always had a great rapport with students who are struggling or who are from difficult family circumstances,"" he said. ""I have found that very helpful in the role of principal and head of school in understanding and helping care for those kinds of students."" After 25 years in the public system he was appointed principal of St Paul’s Grammar School in Penrith, where he worked for 12 years before taking his current job in 2010. St Paul's had been the second school in the state to introduce the International Baccalaureate Diploma and Dr Collier was responsible for extending that program from senior to junior and middle years. Mandarin was compulsory from kindergarten to year 6. It was then taken up by years 7 to 12. ""St Paul's had the largest Mandarin Chinese teaching program in Australia at that time,"" he said. He is now in his 11th year as head of St Andrew's Cathedral School and its Aboriginal school, Gawura. Dr Collier is a huge advocate of Australia's youth, describing them as ""magnificent"". ""They give me great hope for the future,"" he said. While Dr Collier has no interest in changing careers, he says the management and administrative skills a headmaster develops are transferable to chief executive officer roles in the commercial world. He says teaching is a wonderful career for those who love people and want to make a difference. ""It is not a career that is ever going to make you wealthy,"" he said. ""But it is ... one of the critical areas of society because it is preparing young people for the future. ""Most principals would tell you the workload is immense and they deal sometimes with very challenging issues, but they love the work and they are glad they have the role. ""I'd encourage people to look at headship and not be overwhelmed by a sense of the workload, because it is a great opportunity to make a difference.""

37,/national/victoria/schools-left-in-dark-about-how-to-proceed-with-year-12-assessments-20200423-p54mnf.html,Schools left in dark about how to proceed with year 12 assessments,"The abrupt postponement by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority of seminars on assessing year 12 students remotely has left secondary schools in the dark about how to proceed with crucial VCE work,  principals say. The sessions were scheduled for Thursday and Friday, with hundreds of principals expected to log in to discuss how to push ahead with school-assessed coursework (SACs) that will determine students’ VCE and VCAL results. Year 12 students are still waiting to learn how they will complete school-based assessments remotely. Credit:Tribune But school leaders were told by email that the sessions had been cancelled less than an hour before the first one was due to start. It is believed the chief executive of the authority, Sharyn Donald, is unwell. The postponement means schools cannot give year 12 students directions about how they will be assessed this term, more than two weeks after the Andrews government announced that all of term two will be taught remotely. Questions left unanswered include how schools will ensure the authenticity of students’ work and safeguard against cheating on remote assignments, and how to safely conduct practical assessments that require students to attend school. The VCAA had been expected to provide guidance on social distancing requirements and timetabling for on-site assessments. It was also due to clarify which assessments would be completed remotely by students and which ones they would need to attend school to attempt. However, the authority informed principals by email on Thursday afternoon that the two sessions had been postponed. “These will be rescheduled as soon as possible and you will be notified by email as soon as the new timings are known,” the authority said. “We are fully aware that you have many pressing questions and apologise for the short notice.” Mark Murphy, president of the Principals Association of Victorian Catholic Secondary Schools, said it was possible the authority had postponed the sessions so it could be better prepared. But he said the lack of clarity about VCE assessment was the greatest source of anxiety in schools. “I was looking forward to getting some greater clarity with regards to VCE and that is the area of greatest anxiety in all of our school communities at the moment,” Mr Murphy said. Some coursework is being put on hold until the authority gives guidance on how to authenticate students’ work. “SACs need to be done under supervision and because of remote learning we can’t do that, so we're looking for greater clarity about how we can assess students where they normally would be assessed in front of us,” Mr Murphy said. The delay also affects students doing their Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning, whose assessment is heavily reliant on practical assignments. Year 12 exams have already been pushed back until at least December and will possibly run into early January, to compensate for the disruption to the school year created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is most unfair as I am overflowing (hence the expression full of it) with endlessly amusing anecdotes and it would be most unfair not to share them with friends and strangers alike. Replay   My children claim to have been sent into zombie-like trances on family car trips as they were told the location of every Melbourne murder since 1923. The daughter’s primary school teacher was quite strangely outraged when she wrote in an assignment that while watching the evening news she asked her father if he knew anything “amusing”. He told her the shortened history of Melbourne’s underworld war – including how Carl Williams was shot in the guts on his 29th birthday. The teacher wrote in capitals: “THIS IS NOT AMUSING!"" Tell it to the Walkley judges. Her worst mark in secondary school was when I helped her produce a newspaper-style project. I was shattered. She was delighted. Damn you Miss Tridle. Thank goodness she missed out on the present home schooling model. She would have ended up a psychopath. For some time now a former colleague has urged me to tell these priceless anecdotes into a microphone to be reproduced into something called a podcast. (I suspect that is because there is a mute button. Something that doesn’t work in real life.) This led me to rat around in several secret places to rescue tapes - micro ones, cassette ones and even VHS ones (short for Video Home System). It turned out to be a treasure trove of crime material - a 30-year history of Australia’s dark arts. I gathered a box of this audio history and gave it to 3AW sound boffins to reproduce as digital recordings. They looked as if I was asking them to turn a smoke signal into a text message. Yet after finding old micro tape machines and sundry antiques they managed the feat. The tapes acted as a memory trigger for stories transcribed in scrapbooks. A pleasant chat with Mick Gatto.
Credit:Patrick Scala Such as sitting with Mick Gatto in his heavily-fortified home while he explained what happened when in 2004 he shot dead hitman Andrew Veniamin in what a jury accepted was self-defence. Or going back to Easter Thursday, 1986, when a group of crooks set a car bomb to explode right outside the Russell Street police station at lunchtime. Dozens were injured and police constable Angela Taylor lost her life. The red-hot suspect was explosives expert, Nazi sympathiser and police hater Phillip Grant Wilson, who was appearing in the Magistrates Court across the road from the station that very day. I was on leave down at Apollo Bay at the time of the bombing, but Wilson managed to make contact, saying he needed to see me. With good reason. He knew he was the number one suspect, feared he might be shot by police and wanted it put on the record that he was innocent. That night, just over a kilometre from the locked-down bomb site, he told me he was not involved (he was a killer but not that killer): “I’m not a bad sort of guy. I don’t need to hurt people. I never have. I don’t hate anyone. I’ve got a forgiving nature.” Phillip 'The Iceman' Wilson being led into court. He was critical of his nemesis, armed robbery squad detective John Morrish, who he believed had set against him. When Wilson was shot dead 17 months later outside a Richmond chiropractor's, Morrish was considered a suspect. “I was accused of having some complicity in his demise,” he would tell me in another taped interview. He had the perfect alibi as he was in the police club with 200 witnesses. Asked if he would have had time to slip out, commit the murder and return, he said that was impossible because it was this reporter's shout and he wasn’t going to miss that to kill a crook. Fair point. In those days homicide detectives asked suspects to co-operate in video reconstructions. It was amazing how enthusiastically some would participate. Frankston serial killer Paul Charles Denyer got on his hands and knees to dig out the buried purse of one of his victims, emerging triumphantly with the key piece of evidence. In one case a homicide detective asks the killer: “What did you do then?” Killer: “I went and got the gun.” Detective: “Did you want to kill him?” Killer: “F---ing oath ... He said 'Don’t Wayne’, then boom. I blew him away.” In the 1980s Victoria Police went through a period of killing suspects at an unprecedented rate. In each case the police who fired the fatal shots completed a reconstruction. We have every one of them. One of the most infamous crimes in Australia was the attempted murder of NSW undercover detective Mick Drury, who in 1984 was shot in his Sydney home. The would-be killer was hitman Christopher Dale Flannery and the go-between was uber-corrupt cop Roger Rogerson. Detective Sergeant Roger Rogerson: Beginning of the end.Credit:Fairfax Media The man who paid for the job was drug dealer Allan Williams, who thought that with Drury out of the way he would beat his Melbourne heroin charges. It was near midnight in a small office on a deserted floor of a newspaper office when Williams told me his story, that when Drury refused a bribe he agreed to pay for his murder. ‘‘I was a giant in the trade; I thought I was invincible and unpinchable. But I stepped over the line with the Drury thing. It is something I will regret for the rest of my life.’’ Back then I didn’t know why he was keen to talk. Listening now I finally understand. Williams had made statements against Rogerson and had done time for the attempted hit on Drury. He wanted me to tell the underworld that he had only dobbed in a crooked copper and that did not make him an underworld informer. He was saying to fellow heavyweight crooks: ''Don’t worry, I won’t turn on you."" It was the same logic that led drug boss Carl Williams to think if he informed on former drug squad detective Paul Dale he wouldn’t be branded a dog by the rest of the underworld. The fact he was murdered 10 years ago in prison indicates it was a fatal misjudgement. A few years after our interview, Allan Williams was dying from a drug-related blood disease and vowed to kill retired Melbourne detective Brian Murphy. (Perhaps they fell out after Murphy threatened to bite off Williams’ nose.) I immediately warned Murphy to be on guard. In this podcast Brian says when he took his grandchildren to a Carlton restaurant the owner said: “Allan Williams has been in here, he’s got a gun and he’s asking everybody where you are because he wants to kill you.” Brian Murphy. I told him his life was in danger.Credit:John Silvester A few days later I told Murphy Williams was in hospital and wouldn’t be coming out. Sometimes the real true crime story is something no one could make up. Everyone knew serial killer Peter Norris Dupas killed Mersina Halvagis in November 1997 as she tended her grandmother’s grave at the Fawkner cemetery. Her wonderful father George fought for years for justice but the prosecutors lacked that final piece of evidence. It came from the most unlikely source. Andrew Fraser was a criminal lawyer, hated by many police, who had been convicted on cocaine charges. Fraser did time with Dupas and a policeman reinvestigating the case rang him in prison, fully expecting the former lawyer to tell him to clear off. Instead Fraser said: “What took you so long?” Dupas was already serving a life sentence and it is to the credit of the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Paul (later Justice) Coghlan, that the case was run at all. He felt the Halvagis family had the right to hear the truth. Dupas was convicted and they had their day in court. Fraser and I were not close but when I approached him, he agreed to tell his story. After the trial he was broke and could have done paid media interviews. Instead he stuck to our handshake (remember those?) agreement. James ""Jim Jim"" Brandes, aka Sleepy Jim, was sent from the US to Australia by the Hells Angels to kill policemen Bob Armstrong and Steele Waterman. Seen here after being detained at Melbourne Airport in August 1982.  Doing the podcast has given me the chance to catch up with a few serious characters who are now long retired. Brian Murphy was in his workshop listening to classical music and making furniture for his grandkids. Steele Waterman was one of the first police to take on the Hells Angels and managed to persuade a key member to give up the secrets, including how they had their own man on a jury to make sure they wouldn’t be convicted of serious drug charges. When the gang brought out a US Hells Angels hitman to kill two local police, they nabbed him at Melbourne Airport, urinated on his club jacket and chucked him on the next plane out, telling him to piss off - literally. Nick Cecil, one of Australia’s first undercover police, talks about his attempts to catch Great Train Robber Ronald Biggs and how he would take the Biggs kids back to his house to play with his own children. Former armed robbery squad detective Ken Ashworth talks of his quite unique relationship with master escaper and prolific stick-up man Chris Binse. The Naked City podcasts begin on April 29.

41,/national/victoria/mortgage-broker-in-protective-custody-after-condemnation-over-deadly-crash-20200424-p54n2c.html,Mortgage broker in protective custody after condemnation over deadly crash,"Millionaire mortgage broker Richard Pusey has been put in protective custody at a Melbourne prison after he was condemned on Friday by senior police and politicians over allegations he taunted a dying policewoman in the aftermath of a horror crash that left four officers dead. Mr Pusey was placed into the same area of Melbourne Assessment Prison once occupied by the now acquitted Cardinal George Pell. A court on Friday heard that Mr Pusey complained about damage to his black Porsche 911 while filming the graphic scene after a truck ploughed into his vehicle and two police cars on the Eastern Freeway on Wednesday. Richard Pusey faces numerous charges over Wednesday's crash on the Eastern Freeway in which four police died.Credit:AAP Police have told The Age that an ice pipe was found in the cabin of the truck involved in the crash. They said a second pipe was found during a search of the driver's home on Wednesday. Investigators were hopeful on Friday night of getting medical clearance to interview driver Mohinder Singh Bajwa, 47, who has been at Royal Melbourne Hospital under police guard since suffering a medical episode immediately after the collision. Mr Pusey appeared dishevelled as he faced court charged with numerous offences, including driving at dangerous speed, reckless conduct endangering life and failing to render assistance. The court heard that after the crash Mr Pusey walked up to Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor as she was pinned to the truck and was heard on body-cam footage saying: ""There you go, amazing, absolutely amazing. All I wanted to do was go home and have some sushi and now you f---ed my f---ing car."" Mr Pusey's alleged actions were condemned on Friday afternoon by Police Association secretary Wayne Gatt. ""This week four police heroes died and one coward lived,"" he said. Police Commissioner Graham Ashton described Mr Pusey's alleged actions as evil. ""Sometimes events occur when you’re reminded that evil walks among us. This has been one of those days,” Mr Ashton said. Police Minister Lisa Neville also spoke about the allegations, saying she hoped the victims' families would not hear what was raised in court. ""Completely sickening and disgusting,"" she said. Senior Constable Kevin King, Constable  Josh Prestney, Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor and Constable Glen Humphris. In a packed courtroom on Friday, homicide squad detective Aaron Price became emotional at times as he described the events of Wednesday night's crash. Mr Pusey was pulled over on Wednesday afternoon for allegedly travelling at 149km/h on the freeway and allegedly tested positive to ice and cannabis. He was walking over to urinate on the side of the freeway when a prime mover veered into the emergency lane and hit the four officers. New recruits Constable Josh Prestney and Constable Glen Humphris were killed alongside senior colleagues Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor and Senior Constable Kevin King. Senior Detective Price told the court that Senior Constable Taylor's body-worn camera continued recording and captured the aftermath of the collision. Mr Pusey later told police he heard ""just bang"" and looked around to see ""my car being pushed with the truck on top of it"". The black Porsche under the semi-trailer after the crash.Credit:AAP As multiple passersby got out of their cars to help, Mr Pusey then allegedly took two iPhones from his car and walked around the scene using a phone to record videos. The body-cam footage captured Mr Pusey walking up to Senior Constable Taylor as she was pinned to the truck. She can be heard groaning before Mr Pusey allegedly taunted her. A pathologist has told police it was likely Senior Constable Taylor was still alive at that point. The body-cam footage also captured a passerby telling Mr Pusey to leave the scene as he is filming. He responded: ""That’s my f---ing car, mate."" Mr Pusey asked someone for a lift to Fitzroy and was dropped on the corner of Alexandra Parade and Smith Street, the court heard. Police said he then called his wife and told her what he had seen. Later that night, he allegedly called a federal police officer he knew, told her about the crash and sent her a video, and also sent pictures of the crime scene to a friend, joking that he was hoping to get out of the fine. He called the Fitzroy Police Station between 10pm and 11pm on Wednesday, and was asked to come to the station but allegedly said ""he just couldn’t"" and went to bed. Mr Pusey attended Melbourne West Police Station in Spencer Street with his lawyer about 9.40am on Thursday, bringing with him a mobile phone which he told police was the device he used at the scene. ""Inquiries revealed he had in fact intentionally given police the wrong phone, which had been restored to factory settings,"" Senior Detective Price told the court. A search warrant was conducted at Mr Pusey's home on Thursday afternoon and an iPhone 11, which police believe he used to film the scene, was discovered. Police also seized a small quantity of the drug ice. Mr Pusey remained expressionless during the court hearing, at times bowing his head and looking at his lap. He is also charged with failing to remain after a drug test, destruction of evidence and three counts of committing an indictable offence while on bail. He will next face court on July 16. On Friday afternoon, Todd Robinson, the devastated partner of Constable Glen Humphris spoke of his pain, his ""soulmate's"" love for policing and of the ""adventurous"" life they had built together. Replay   Mr Robinson said senior police officers knocked on his door on Wednesday night to inform him of his partner's death while he was cooking dinner for Constable Humphris, who grew up on the NSW Central Coast. ""My soulmate has gone"" he said. ""He is gone and I'm still coming to terms with that. That door is not going to open and he’s not going to bumble in, say 'hello' to me and grab the dog, and me and him go off for a walk."" Police have results from the drug and alcohol tests conducted on Cranbourne truck driver Mr Singh Bajwa, but have not released them as they wait to interview him. Police have not described the nature of his medical condition, but have said it was not a result of the accident. Commissioner Ashton said: ""We will get some further information available to the detectives later today on the crash reconstruction stuff so these vehicles these days, with all the GPS and everything else, there’s a lot of data held and … they’ll have quite a good reconstruction."" ""The mere fact that he is in hospital and we have been unable to get to him doesn’t mean that they have had to sit idle. They’ve been able to actually do a lot of work on reconstruction prior to him being available for interview."" Commissioner Ashton and Deputy Commissioner Patton have both dismissed reports of the truck driver being pulled over earlier in the day as rumour. Four small funerals for the fallen police officers killed in the Eastern Freeway tragedy will take place in coming weeks before a larger public memorial service with full police honours is held as soon as possible after coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Mr Ashton said they had received an “outpouring of support” for the policing community on online tribute pages.

42,/national/victoria/code-blue-women-healthcare-workers-on-state-s-violent-front-line-20200424-p54n20.html,"'Code blue': Women, healthcare workers on state's violent front line","A new report shows 20 per cent of Victorian government employees have reported violence or aggression in their workplaces, with women in the health sector bearing the brunt. The annual State of the Public Sector report, published on Friday, shows healthcare workers facing higher levels of violence than police and emergency services. Young women working in the health sector are especially likely to be attacked.Credit:Peter Braig Women aged between 18 and 34 were most likely to report workplace violence, with a quarter of the people in that age bracket who took part in the survey suffering assault or aggression in the previous 12 months. Victoria’s hospitals, clinics and other healthcare settings emerged as the public sector’s most dangerous workplaces with one in four respondents enduring a “code blue” incident in the 12 months before the incident. The workplace violence figures follow attempts by the Andrews government to legislate tougher sentences for attacks on paramedics and other emergency services workers, and campaigns by health authorities to try to deter abuse and violence towards their employees. But despite the rising danger levels in their workplaces, doctors, nurses and their colleagues reported feeling less stressed than teachers, police officers and departmental public servants. Women aged between 18 and 34 were most likely to report workplace violence with 25 per cent suffering assault or aggression in the previous 12 months. Most attacks came from “clients, customers, patients, stakeholders or members of the public” but one in five of the public sector workers who had experienced violence said the perpetrator was a manager or colleague. Public school teachers and other educators emerged from the giant Public Sector Commission's People Matters survey as the state’s most stressed government workers, with 28 per cent of them reporting “high to severe” stress levels. But there was better news on bullying, harassment and discrimination in government workplaces, with a significant year-on-year decrease recorded in 2019 for the third year in a row. A government spokesman told The Age on Friday that the results of the survey and the report were welcome because they allowed workplace authorities to identify dangers to their employees and to act to protect them. “You can’t fix problems you don’t know about, that’s why this report is so important,” the spokesman said. “It helps identify what we’re doing well, and what we need to address to better support our workforce. “We've made steady improvements across a range of areas but we know there’s more to do.” The report also showed the overall government workforce grew to more than 323,000 in 2019, an increase of about 48,000 or about 18 per cent since 2014 when the Andrews Labor government came to power. Most of the public sector employees are teachers, healthcare workers, police, paramedics or other emergency service workers with only about 16 per cent of government employees working in the public service. The spokesman said the Andrews government was proud of its record of hiring more frontline workers. “We make no apologies for employing more nurses, teachers, police and other vital roles that make Victorians safer and healthier, and drive reforms that make Victoria stronger and fairer,” he said.

Fortitude Valley nightclub Sub Rosa has streamed four-hour live DJ sessions for the past three Saturdays, complete with smoke effects and dance-floor lights. DJ Tomix has been one of the DJs spinning the decks on Sub Rosa's virtual nightclub live streams. Owner Shane Brady said the venue was closed in line with the novel coronavirus restrictions but the streaming idea had allowed three staff to keep working. ""It was suggested by one of our DJs that we somehow move online,"" he said. ""We have done live streams in the past, so we thought: 'Since people can’t come to us, we’ll come to them and give them back their Saturday routine for a few hours.' ""We have tried to create a real atmosphere in an empty nightclub, so we dressed the place up in different themes each week. ""This week's theme is a Rum Jungle session; we have already done Tech House and Progressive House themes."" The loud music, lights and activity in the venue has attracted several visits from police. ""The first weekend someone complained about the noise, so the police came, looked around, saw there was only a cameraman and DJ and said: 'Good on you, keep it up',"" Mr Brady said. ""The following week, someone complained we had an illegal party going on here, so a van-load of officers turned up. The shape of inflatable animals were mistaken for party-goers and prompted one nearby resident to call the police. ""They quickly realised the shapes the caller had seen were a bunch of inflatable animals, so the younger constables had a bit of a chuckle. ""One of the other officers said: 'We know what you’ve been doing here. You're under the noise limit, so keep going.' ""Last week the police didn’t come. They have been brilliant, they realise we’re just trying to do something for people."" The virtual nightclub sessions run every Saturday from 4pm-8pm. This weekend's live stream will honour the Anzac Day legacy, with The Last Post to be played at 6pm and a minute's silence observed in between DJ sets. Mr Brady said the live streams were significantly increasing the venue's social media following and helping staff keep in touch with customers. ""We're getting a couple of hundred people watching the live stream, which is similar to an average Friday or Saturday,"" he said. ""People have been linking up and having online parties on Zoom and dancing to the music, it’s just been a really nice thing ... it's a diversion and puts a smile on people's faces - so it’s all worth it. ""We thought we were dead and it was all over when the government measures were introduced but we will be fine for another three or four months, but if this goes on longer, it will be tough.""

""Virgin has significant outstanding invoices from Perth Airport for airfield and terminal use charges – money the airline has already collected from its passengers and the FIFO sector,"" an airport spokesman said in a statement to Nine News Perth. ""While Perth Airport is working with the Virgin administrators, it also needs to protect its own interests. ""Perth Airport has taken liens over a number of Virgin aircraft – a standard practice in these situations. The aircraft affected are not being used for current FIFO or interstate operations and have been parked at Perth Airport for some time now. ""There will be zero impact on the state's resources sector. ""At this point in time, we continue to facilitate Virgin’s FIFO flights through T2 while we try to secure an agreement with the administrators."" AFL club members could claim tax refunds on their 2020 subscriptions in an Australian arts industry model being explored by the clubs. Clubs are waiting on a ruling from the Australian Taxation Office, which would benefit members who continue to financially support their clubs despite the likelihood of being prevented from attending the remainder of the season's games due to coronavirus restrictions. Geelong chairman Colin Carter is understood to have raised the prospect of clubs exploring the Opera Australia subscribers model at a presidents meeting. Now the recently formed working group of club chiefs working on membership has put forward a proposal to the ATO on behalf of all club members. Clubs are also looking at a second, less preferred option under which memberships and reserved seating costs could be transformed into tax deductible donations under the Australian Sports Foundation program. Clubs such as Hawthorn, raising money for a new facility at Dingley, would lose six per cent of each donation under the second model. Read the full story here. A Queensland man who allegedly left his mandatory hotel quarantine after just one night to go on an ""alcohol and meth binge"" around Perth's CBD has been denied bail as police push for a jail term. Douglas Nothdurft, 33, flew into the state on April 3, 2020 – less than a week after WA announced any interstate travellers would be required to isolate in a government-appointed hotel for 14 days. Mr Nothdurft allegedly gave a false name on his declaration slip before disembarking his flight and was transferred to the Criterion Hotel to begin his quarantine period. Police prosecutor Mike O’Leary said Mr Nothdurft left the hotel after one night, allegedly telling staff he would quarantine at a different hotel. He then spent the following two nights at the Pensione Hotel, and then the Akara Hotel – and on one of the nights shared a room with three other people. The hotels are not government-approved quarantine facilities. For the following five days Mr Nothdurft’s whereabouts were unknown, with the accused man allegedly telling police who found him at the Perth Train Station he couldn’t remember what he had been doing. “He was questioned by police and by his own admissions he stated he’d been on an alcohol and methamphetamine binge for a few days and been walking around the city and couldn’t recall where he’d been or what he’d been doing and police hadn’t been able to establish his movements between the 6th and 10th of April,” Sergeant O’Leary said.

Australia Post has announced it is suspending next-day delivery guarantees for express post, citing limited flights, social distancing requirements and a substantial increase in parcel volumes as reasons for delays. ""Express Post is still available but parcels may not be delivered next business day every time,"" the postal service said in a statement to customers on Friday. ""We ask for your patience with our contact centre colleagues based here in Australia who are doing their best to keep up with the additional demand."" Post offices remain open around the country, but have implemented social distancing measures including limiting the number of people in store at any time. ""Cleaning standards and personal hygiene guidelines have also been provided,"" the company said. ""Counter safety screens to improve hygiene and reduce risks are also currently being rolled out across the country. The response to this has been positive so far."" Although the World Health Organisation and the Australian Department of Health have stated that the risk of contracting COVID-19 through the handling of mail or parcels is extremely low, Australia Post has introduced health and safety protocols ""that ensure that mail and parcels are handled safely and that human contact is minimised.""

Douglas Nothdurft, 33, flew into the state on April 3, 2020 – less than a week after WA announced any interstate travellers would be required to isolate in a government-appointed hotel for 14 days. The man was meant to stay at the Criterion Hotel for two weeks, but allegedly left after just one night. Credit:Google Maps Mr Nothdurft allegedly gave a false name on his declaration slip before disembarking his flight and was transferred to the Criterion Hotel to begin his quarantine period. Police prosecutor Mike O’Leary said Mr Nothdurft left the hotel after one night, allegedly telling staff he would quarantine at a different hotel. He then spent the following two nights at the Pensione Hotel, and then the Akara Hotel – and on one of the nights shared a room with three other people. The hotels are not government-approved quarantine facilities. For the following five days Mr Nothdurft’s whereabouts were unknown, with the accused man allegedly telling police who found him at the Perth Train Station he couldn’t remember what he had been doing. “He was questioned by police and by his own admissions he stated he’d been on an alcohol and methamphetamine binge for a few days and been walking around the city and couldn’t recall where he’d been or what he’d been doing and police hadn’t been able to establish his movements between the 6th and 10th of April,” Sergeant O’Leary said. “He further admitted to providing false details on the declaration form and stated he came to Western Australia because he wanted to go travelling.” Mr Nothdurft was taken to hospital and tested for COVID-19 before he was arrested and taken to an isolation cell at Hakea Prison. On Friday, Magistrate Matthew Walton denied the 33-year-old bail and said his excuses for breaching the order were selfish. “This is a very serious charge in the current environment,” he said. “[His reasons for breaching the order] feed into the one common feature, obsessive self-interest and an inability to see the world in any other way other than through his own eyes and for his own self-interests, sometimes it’s called narcissism ... just blatant selfishness. “He couldn’t possibly have known whether he did or did not [have COVID-19] and put others at risk.” Mr Nothdurft’s lawyer, Gregory Chin, said his client had no criminal record in WA and had a history of mental health issues. He said his client’s quarantine period was now over and his hope was to be released on bail to stay at a hotel or hostel while awaiting the finalisation of his court matter. Mr Nothdurft said he left his hotel quarantine because he couldn’t afford to pay the bond and he had no phone to order food to his room. “I knew I didn’t have no COVID and that ... I didn’t want to put no one at risk,” he said. “I’ve put myself back on shame by doing this.” Mr Nothdurft's COVID-19 test returned negative. Sergeant O’Leary indicated police would seek a jail term. Mr Nothdurft will next appear in Perth Magistrates Court on April 30. He is yet to enter a plea. The maximum penalty for a person who fails to comply with a self-isolation direction under the Emergency Management Act is 12 months imprisonment or a $50,000 fine. WA Police were unable to confirm how many people had been charged with the offence. Last week, Victorian man Jonathan David, 35, was jailed for a minimum of one month after he repeatedly breached his Perth hotel quarantine to visit his girlfriend in Armadale.
