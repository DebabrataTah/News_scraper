Mayors representing Bathurst, Mudgee and Dubbo say their towns would be ideally placed to trial the easing of restrictions - if such a strategy was endorsed by NSW health authorities - because of their scant case numbers. Dubbo is one of the regional cities that has put its hand up for the relaxation of social distancing measures. Credit:Janie Barrett Any such move is likely to also require the consideration of internal border controls to protect towns that reopen, as is already in place in Western Australia. Mid-Western Regional Council, which takes in Mudgee, has had six confirmed COVID-19 cases. Mayor Des Kennedy argued it was a ""fabulous idea"" for authorities to use sparsely populated towns as a yardstick. ""We're nearly free of active cases,"" he said. ""Give it a whirl for a month and if you see all of a sudden that region gets cases, we know we’re going too soon."" Adrian Piccoli, director of the Gonski Institute for Education and a former NSW Coalition education minister, also argued schools should reopen full-time in unaffected regional areas. ""When there's a bushfire, you don't have to shut every school because a dozen schools are closed,"" he said. ""If there was an outbreak of the virus in Condobolin, they would not shut schools in Woollahra."" Professor Piccoli said their sprawling facilities were well-suited to social distancing. But the concept of tiered restrictions has met opposition, including from Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, who argued on Sky News it was a case of ""one in, all in"". Regional towns popular with tourists have also been less than enthusiastic. Community leaders from the South Coast and Snowy Mountains warned they would be inundated by Sydneysiders if relaxations went ahead. Snowy Monaro Regional Council has recorded six COVID-19 cases, and normally its businesses - battered by the bushfires - would have been relying heavily on the upcoming snow season. But mayor Peter Beer said it would be impossible to prevent an influx of visitors if there was any easing of rules. ""If we do get a big crowd like we do in winter, our medical facilities cannot handle an outbreak,"" he said. Associate Professors Adam Kamradt-Scott and Adam Dunn from Sydney University developed an interactive dashboard that could be key to determining which local government areas could relax their social distancing measures first. Professor Dunn said there was a risk people could become confused by mixed messages if there were different rules for different towns. ""You could have a situation where people aren't aware of local restrictions, you could have shops open when they're not meant to,"" he said. ""The last thing we want to see is a big second wave, that would be terrible."" Professor Kamradt-Scott was also involved in developing Australia's pandemic plans and said they allowed for a regional-first approach. However, he said the easing of restrictions was a decision for the government and internal border controls were likely to be a significant issue. ""It would involve a hell of a lot of resources, and the question is, is that an appropriate use of resources at this point in time?"" he said. The mayor of Dubbo Regional Council, Ben Shields, was supportive of a reopening if it was recommended. But he was dubious about the effectiveness of internal border controls. ""Dubbo is a shopping destination for all of western NSW,"" he said. ""Dubbo has a population of around 58,000, but 130,000 people do their business and shopping in Dubbo.""

2,/national/nsw/to-those-lost-in-and-after-wars-thank-you-for-your-sacrifice-20200423-p54mn8.html,To those lost in and after wars: thank you for your sacrifice,"Illustration: Alan MoirCredit:  In recent months, Australia’s real heroes have been thousands of firefighters, emergency staff, health workers, teachers and others who have braved fire, flood and deadly disease in their efforts to protect us. Our heartfelt thanks to them all. But on Anzac Day, since marches and gatherings are not possible, let us all take some quiet time in our isolation to remember those brave men and women who heroically risked their lives in the wars throughout Australia’s history. We lost many wonderful people in these conflicts, or as a result of post-war physical and mental trauma and there have been equally devastating effects on their families. To those who are gone, and to those who still survive, thank you. We will never forget. Rob Phillips, North Epping Will Martin shares his family history of service and sacrifice (''My father's tears for his dad lost in battle'', April 24). Many families have similar experiences to remember on Anzac Day. I reflect on the poignant story of young soldiers who survived the war but died from the Spanish flu and who are buried in France. War is abhorrent. We have many service men and women who have returned from recent wars with PTSD. The government could show respect for their service by increasing funding and services for them as they recover. Bea Hodgson, Gerringong  Let us remember, too, the Anzac women of the past, those largely written out of the official histories, who nursed, drove ambulances, retrieved the injured, fell dead into the water on Radji Beach, endured atrocities inflicted upon women in wartime, kept the families and the industries going back home, welcomed back their forever-changed menfolk when the horrors were over. Lest we forget. Megan Brock Summer Hill  I sat down to my night meal with my four almost adult children, a rare event. My healthy eldest daughter at our table after 14 days of self-isolation and a harrowing journey home from an apocalyptic London. I felt the ball of tightness in my chest ease just a little. And I thought of mothers before me whose children were sent out to war, not brought home – for years on end. Lest we forget. Rani Sachdev, Cronulla To me, Anzac Day is a day of mourning. Perhaps this Anzac Day will enable us to be more reflective and thoughtful about the horrors and consequences of war, about which so many war veterans have spoken so often for decades. Adrianne Hannan, Bowral June Chung, if I may speak for others: we are all proud of, and grateful to, your dad (Letters, April 24). Patrick McGrath, Potts Point What a generous and gracious resignation statement by outgoing Rugby Australia (RA) chief executive Raelene Castle (''Castle quits after board loses faith'', April 24). She was brought down not for want of ability but rather by a cruel combination of the hurtful views of one player and the blindside crushing impact of an epidemic. Go well, Raelene. Andrew Thornley, Ashfield The current pickle rugby finds itself in didn’t start with Castle. Since it turned professional, RA has been run by boards and executives who have shown little interest in expanding the game into the broader community. Rather it was pitched as the sport of preference for the corporate sector. The current agitators for change mean well but unless they bring the game to the masses – irrespective of postcode, profession or school – then rugby will continue to struggle for relevance. Mike Kenneally, Balmain  What is wrong with rugby in Australia? Its administration is in disarray. The Wallabies have slipped to seventh in the world. Spectators are deserting the games in droves and TV ratings are plummeting. For many years, rugby has been associated with the big end of town and has drawn its players from private schools, with a special association with the GPS elite. Why discourage the nearly 70 per cent of Australian kids in public schools, reducing the talent pool? This attitude does not exist in NZ, to their obvious benefit. RA needs to start funding and encouraging from the bottom up. Robert Hickey, Green Point  Within a week, the chief executives of both the NRL and RA have gone and now the hunt for their replacements begins. Why would you want the job? You know you are in for a kicking from all sides. David Ritchie, Mosman First Todd Greenberg and now Castle. AFL's Gillon McLachlan and Cricket Australia's Kevin Roberts must be feeling a little nervous. Stephen Manns, Woollahra  Kerry Stokes is exempt from hotel quarantine after returning to WA from world coronavirus hotspot, the USA. Why do we maintain the farce that Australia is an egalitarian society (''Different Stokes for different folks in WA'', April 24)? Don Smith, Ashfield So we’re not actually ''all in this together''. Trevor Sheridan, Charmhaven Russian roulette by another name (“Las Vegas mayor calls for re-opening of casinos as 'control group''', April 24). Mustafa Erem, Terrigal  Why is this present period of time called a ''lockdown'' and not a ''lockup''? My feelings about it all are going up and down (Letters, April 24) Michael Walsh, Ashfield While we are talking about missing syllables and letters, since when was ""twenny twenny "" acceptable? Come on people. Michael Richards, Castlecrag Proponents of the word ""vunerable"" may well say that its use is nowadays just part of ""normacy"". Chris Keay, Castle Hill Please could everyone stop talking about being in “bubbles”. It was only interesting the first thousand times it was mentioned. Jane Waddy, Boronia Park I love working from home. For my online meeting I am wearing a formal blouse, jeans and bare feet. Margaret Grove, Abbotsford I was a union member for my entire teaching career. With few exceptions, I have supported their views, seeing them as always acting in the best interest of the entire school community (''Premier hits out at teachers' alternative'', April 24). However, this time they have forgotten that teachers are frontline workers. Does a fireman decide not to attend a fire because it is too dangerous? Does a nurse say “no, I cannot enter that ward, it is full of sick people”. No. Students need to be educated by teachers in school communities. If some feel they need PPE, let them wear it, if some teachers for health reasons cannot attend, let them work from home. But the safety measures, as well as the process in gradually returning children to school, devised by medical experts and educators, should be adequate for the majority, until proven otherwise. Lyndall Nelson, South Turramurra The Teachers Federation proposes a workable plan that doesn’t expose the entire school community to infection risk. The government insists on an unworkable plan that guarantees entire school communities are exposed. It's almost as if they want to use schools as laboratories to have a look at what this virus does if you take your foot off the brake. Giving teachers and their union a good kicking on the way through is just the cherry on top. Pam Newton, Dee Why As I come to the end of my three-day on-call shift at Gosford Hospital I have been so impressed by my co-healthcare workers. They have all quietly got on with doing what is necessary to care for our patients in a professional manner which is very impressive. I can't help contrasting this with the amount of negativity coming from the teaching community, including the Teachers Federation. Their risk is extremely small. I would suggest they look at their healthcare workers as a model and just get on with the job needed. Dr Bill Munro, Gosford After reading your correspondent’s bewildering account of trying to deal with an ever-changing teaching landscape, it’s clear that one important thing is missing — proper consultation with the people working at the coalface: teachers (Letters, April 24). Bruce Hulbert Lilyfield Waleed Aly rightly points out that COVID-19 has exposed countries where politics plays out as a self-serving game devoid of acknowledged facts and personal accountability, and where the most reprehensible players are awarded the most air-time and society suffers (''Ailing states serve as a warning'', April 24). By contrast, Australia's political classes have shown cohesion and bi-partisanship and have heeded the guidance of medics and science more broadly. This has been a steadying force through COVID-19 and Australians have answered the call. For these things, I must say, I am grateful. Is it too much to hope that the same good sense and good will is maintained post COVID-19? Marie Del Monte, Ashfield I see that the NRL persists with its Project Apollo aimed at getting back to the NRL competition on May 28 (''Nine slams brakes on 'premature' NRL restart'', April 24). I can only hope for their sake that it doesn’t turn out to be Project Icarus as they fly too close to the sun and find their wings melting away leaving them to crash back to earth. Bruce Guthrie, Cowra Attacking Donald Trump because he confused viruses with bacteria, Bob Carr, is the very reason Trump will romp in at the November elections (''Why Trump may reign for another four years'', April 24). That's because most Americans don't know the difference either. So an attack on Trump is an attack on the majority of voters and that is no way to win an election. George Fishman, Vaucluse Being a very simple soul with no knowledge of apps, Bluetooth monitoring or cloud-like apparitions storing our private information, it appears to me that the government decision to appoint Amazon working within an unpredictable foreign power to oversee and store our valuable data is going against everything they are currently advising us to do. We are quite rightly being encouraged to buy local, keep our local businesses open, keep our local economy thriving and to keep Australians in their jobs. It appears there are several Australian organisations which are capable of fulfilling this highly technical and sensitive role, so this decision raises some serious security and ethical questions which need to be answered. Peter Phillipson, Fingal Bay Knowing that putting the government’s COVID-19 app on my phone could reduce the spread of this disease, and therefore reduce the loss of life from it, as well as getting some of the many people who have become unemployed as a result of existing efforts to achieve this aim, will inspire me to do so it as soon as possible. Any fears I could have that a few inept politicians and their staffers could do anything with the information such an app would provide are minimal compared to the worry I occasionally devote to what Mr Google and company are doing with the information they have been collecting on me ever since I turned my first smart phone on. Margaret Broadbent, Dunbogan The law is very clear: on a shared path, a cyclist must keep left, slow down and give way to pedestrians at all times, even if that means coming to a stop (Letters, April 24). To threaten or intimidate pedestrians and put them in fear of their safety is an assault, which includes ringing a bell when there is no emergency. To do so by coughing during the COVID-19 pandemic, should see that person doing some serious jail time. Harold Scruby, Chairman Pedestrian Council of Australia  The arts perform a vital role: asking questions, moving and confronting us, and providing us with a sense of cultural identity, as does the ABC (“Arts call for show of support”, April 24). Both creative arts and the ABC should get more federal funding. Support them so they can support us all. Diana Wyndham, North Sydney Congratulations to the ABC for their lovely renditions of We Are Australian. The harmonising and the images of happy, smiling faces, representing our diversity, are delightful. I normally get sick of these ABC ads, but I can’t get enough of these. This has to be our national anthem. Andrew Macintosh, Cromer  With the huge number of face masks now being worn by so many folks, I am surprised that the creative marketing types have not taken the initiative to cover them with advertising material. They could perhaps kick off with a beer promotion. John Andrews, Clovelly It’s not fair! Now that I have the time to keep my house clean and tidy, I know I’ll have no visitors. Joan Lambert, Adamstown ''The plethora of letters regarding isolation is completely understandable during these unusual times,'' writes Christine Hackwood of North Lakes. But like many in the lead up to Anzac Day she adds that her mind ''wanders to a different time and different circumstances'', explaining how her father was called up for WWII, leaving behind a wife and a five-month-old, spending time in Changi and Kobe, Japan, until the end of the war. ''Throughout his incarceration my mother had little information about his whereabouts or health. He endured years of deprivation and isolation. He was a doctor and witnessed daily horrors while desperately trying to help his fellow prisoners and stay alive,'' she writes, adding that ''our present dilemma is tough and uncertain; more so for some than others. However, it is an opportunity to take stock of our lives, realise what is really important and hopefully come out the other side to a more generous society''. John Croker of Lindfield, writes that ''Anzac Day, in my family as in many others, is a special day''. ''I remember with pride my father, his father and his grandfather who all went to war to ensure we had a free country,'' he writes. ''I cannot overstate how much I value their sacrifice, not just on Anzac Day but whenever I think of it."" Doug Walker of Baulkham Hills says ''this year is a unique Anzac Day. Even during the 1919 influenza pandemic, from which 974 people had died in NSW between late January and April 24, the Anzacs were still on parade (although people were not permitted to watch) and services held in churches and memorials, with a large gathering in the Domain where the Herald observed that 'masks were worn by the majority of the gathering'''. But as Tony Everett of Wareemba succintly reminds us, we are still able to pay our respects, simply by ''remembering''. Pat Stringa, letters editor   Copyright © 2020", ,"April 25, 2020"

Even during the 1919 influenza pandemic, from which 974 people had died in NSW between late January and April 24, the Anzacs were still on parade (although people were not permitted to watch) and services held in churches and memorials, with a large gathering in the Domain where the Herald observed that 'masks were worn by the majority of the gathering'''. But as Tony Everett of Wareemba succintly reminds us, we are still able to pay our respects, simply by ''remembering''. Pat Stringa, letters editor   Copyright © 2020", ,"April 25, 2020"

The woman, who asked for her family not to be named as they had ""already suffered enough"", said the lawyer’s failures had seen her son wrongfully imprisoned for more than a year. When her son, who had been charged over his role in a pub brawl, was presented with further charges by police Croke told him not to worry and that because ""it’s basically all crap"". When his day in court arrived on January 30, 2009 the young man said he was bewildered when Croke, at the bar table, nodded to him to plead guilty to the new charges. Despite expressing his shock at what had happened in court that day, Croke assured him it would all be fine. ""I’ve been doing this for over 20 years … don’t worry, you will only get a slap on the wrist,"" his solicitor said. But the young man didn’t get a slap on the wrist - he was jailed for two-and-a-half years. In 2010 he told the NSW Court of Appeal he had not read or signed the statement of facts. ""I would never have agreed to what it said as it was not true,"" he said. In a scathing assessment of Croke, appeal court judge Anthony Whealy said that ""at no time"" had the man been shown the agreed statement of facts, nor were they explained to him. ""Mr Croke, of course, insisted that they were. It is significant, however, that Mr Croke was unable to produce notes of any conference that he had ever had."" Nor could the solicitor produce any written instructions relating to the plea, Justice Whealy said. Ordering the convictions be quashed and the young man be released without the delay, Justice Whealy said the episode had been a ""serious miscarriage of justice"". Croke subsequently received a ""reprimand"" from the Law Society for, among other things, failing to explain to his client what he was pleading guilty to. This was not the first time the judiciary had had reason to be concerned about Croke’s unprofessional conduct. In 1999 District Court Judge Joe Phelan was furious when Croke failed to turn up on the first day of his client’s trial, causing a three-month delay. Judge Phelan noted that Croke had done this before. The judge advised the accused to find someone else to represent him. One of Croke’s own co-accused, music promoter Andrew McManus, had previously sued him for professional negligence. McManus, who was sentenced to a 20-month intensive corrections order over his role in lying to police over the $702,000, gave evidence at Croke's trial that the solicitor had coached him on his fabricated version of events.

When McManus was pursued over a nightclub debt, Croke failed to turn up to the Federal Court to contest a default judgment which had been entered against McManus.

And perhaps we will, we small guys. But the rules are different up there. Chances are, when this COVID nightmare ends, we’ll be Rumpelstiltskinned back into a world hurtling to oblivion. Governments impoverished by mass wage subsidy, tax loss and ballooning unemployment will be more than ever in thrall to big business. This may seem insignificant now, compared with the immediate life-and-death fears of virus land, but remember. Big Business need you to think that. It needs you passive, glued to the couch, frightened. And no, to be clear, I’m not saying rip off your mask and rush out into the streets. I’m saying exercise your mind. While you and I are dutifully swallowing our daily dose of Stan and Netflix, remnant forest is being logged, Adani is undermining the Galilee Basin, coalmines are being approved and extended and developers are rejoicing as government empowers itself to speed approvals, supercharge ministerial discretion and diminish protections. Just when you thought our cities had been thoroughly trashed by a decade-long onslaught of towers and motorways, it’s set to get worse. Just when you thought NSW’s new building commissioner would surely respond to tower buildings that crack and burn without warning by re-regulating construction, the government tips the board the other way. For government, cheered on – one might even say led – by the development lobby, has removed virtually all planning constraint during the crisis. While we stewed, housebound, through Easter, greater planning change was effected – with more haste, less fanfare, less discussion and the potential for far more dramatic consequence – than at any time since Sydney landowners ganged up on Governor Macquarie and told him what the rules really were. First, on March 24, came the COVID-19 Legislation Amendment (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 (NSW), which slid through both houses of Parliament and became law, all in a single day. That sketched a new superpower landscape. A week later, Planning Minister Rob Stokes dug a little hole and tucked into it a landmine called the Planning System Acceleration Program. It sounds innocent. Well, natch. The amended act gives Stokes between six and 12 months of virtually unlimited discretion to authorise any development on any land “without the need for any approval under the act or consent from any person”. No agreement is required from Parliament, cabinet or the department, and definitely not from the public. Nor need other legislative controls apply – heritage, environment, water. It’s just nice Mr Stokes in consultation with the Minister for Health. Those who yearn to trust government note that the minister can only make such orders if he is “reasonably satisfied” that they’re necessary to “protect the health, safety and welfare of members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic”. I say, define reasonably. Define health. The trusters murmur gently (while sloshing umbrage over any suggestion of non-COVID priorities) that such absolutism is only to enable building of hospitals and testing stations. It’s necessary, they say, to allow the conversion of a convention centre, say, to an emergency hospital. The minister would never abuse such powers. Wouldn’t he, though? Just how safe is it to bestow our trust on government in such generous quantities? Is unfettered ministerial power really good for our health? Consider. Construction was already deemed an “essential activity”, which is why half the traffic in our newly deserted streets is construction trucking. One of the minister’s first orders under the new law, on April 2, was to expand building hours so that commercial and infrastructure construction can continue through weekends and public holidays. That might still sound pretty innocuous, especially given the standard jobs-jobs-jobs catch-cry. “The extended hours allow the industry to facilitate social distancing on construction sites,” said the minister, “while minimising the potential for lost productivity during the pandemic.” So, yes, the new regime came in full PPE, guised as an essential health measure. Similarly clad was the minister’s next-day announcement of the acceleration program. The government says fast-track planning processes will keep people in jobs and the construction industry moving throughout the COVID-19 crisis. If that were the priority, though, you might expect similar support for the arts sector which generates $16.4 billion to NSW GDP and employs 118,000 FTE workers. You might think Sydney’s recent transformation by the biggest building boom in its history – leaving it strewn with cookie-cutter clumps of resi-towers and communities that, from Parramatta to Frenchs Forest, feel overwhelmed and underconsulted – indicated a lack of planning. Apparently not. Apparently Sydney is asphyxiated by red planning tape – according, at least, to developer lobby group Urban Task Force, which not only welcomed but pretty much took credit for the decision to “cut red tape and … fast-track reforms”. “We have been calling for a fast-track system for assessments of big projects for six months,” crowed the taskforce’s Tom Forrest. Six months. That’s well before anyone had heard of COVID-19. And there’s more coming. “Today’s announcement represents the start ...”  Apparently at Treasury’s request, the taskforce sent the government a list of 70 projects requiring the fast-track treatment. These include many that are “stuck” in the planning system because, let’s be frank, people detest them. Meriton’s proposal for a clutch of towers up to 22 storeys at Little Bay Cove, Bilbergia’s 440-apartment development at St Leonards, Mirvac’s proposal for West Pennant Hills and Walker Corp’s $16 billion proposal for 4000 dwellings in the Greater Macarthur Growth Area. Stokes is a nice guy. He’s also the pretty face for the much more ruthless Dominic Perrottet, whose agency – says the Urban Task Force - has been “driving planning reform in NSW”. Trust them with such unchecked power if you dare. Hand the public interest to a government that has flogged or destroyed many of our finest public assets and developed public land with enthusiasm. I say, good luck with that. Elizabeth Farrelly is a Sydney-based columnist and author who holds a PhD in architecture and several international writing awards.

While we stewed, housebound, through Easter, greater planning change was effected – with more haste, less fanfare, less discussion and the potential for far more dramatic consequence – than at any time since Sydney landowners ganged up on Governor Macquarie and told him what the rules really were. First, on March 24, came the COVID-19 Legislation Amendment (Emergency Measures) Act 2020 (NSW), which slid through both houses of Parliament and became law, all in a single day. That sketched a new superpower landscape. A week later, Planning Minister Rob Stokes dug a little hole and tucked into it a landmine called the Planning System Acceleration Program. It sounds innocent. Well, natch. The amended act gives Stokes between six and 12 months of virtually unlimited discretion to authorise any development on any land “without the need for any approval under the act or consent from any person”. No agreement is required from Parliament, cabinet or the department, and definitely not from the public. Nor need other legislative controls apply – heritage, environment, water. It’s just nice Mr Stokes in consultation with the Minister for Health. Those who yearn to trust government note that the minister can only make such orders if he is “reasonably satisfied” that they’re necessary to “protect the health, safety and welfare of members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic”. I say, define reasonably. Define health. The trusters murmur gently (while sloshing umbrage over any suggestion of non-COVID priorities) that such absolutism is only to enable building of hospitals and testing stations. It’s necessary, they say, to allow the conversion of a convention centre, say, to an emergency hospital. The minister would never abuse such powers. Wouldn’t he, though? Just how safe is it to bestow our trust on government in such generous quantities? Is unfettered ministerial power really good for our health? Consider. Construction was already deemed an “essential activity”, which is why half the traffic in our newly deserted streets is construction trucking. One of the minister’s first orders under the new law, on April 2, was to expand building hours so that commercial and infrastructure construction can continue through weekends and public holidays. That might still sound pretty innocuous, especially given the standard jobs-jobs-jobs catch-cry. “The extended hours allow the industry to facilitate social distancing on construction sites,” said the minister, “while minimising the potential for lost productivity during the pandemic.” So, yes, the new regime came in full PPE, guised as an essential health measure. Similarly clad was the minister’s next-day announcement of the acceleration program. The government says fast-track planning processes will keep people in jobs and the construction industry moving throughout the COVID-19 crisis. If that were the priority, though, you might expect similar support for the arts sector which generates $16.4 billion to NSW GDP and employs 118,000 FTE workers. You might think Sydney’s recent transformation by the biggest building boom in its history – leaving it strewn with cookie-cutter clumps of resi-towers and communities that, from Parramatta to Frenchs Forest, feel overwhelmed and underconsulted – indicated a lack of planning. Apparently not. Apparently Sydney is asphyxiated by red planning tape – according, at least, to developer lobby group Urban Task Force, which not only welcomed but pretty much took credit for the decision to “cut red tape and … fast-track reforms”. “We have been calling for a fast-track system for assessments of big projects for six months,” crowed the taskforce’s Tom Forrest. Six months. That’s well before anyone had heard of COVID-19. And there’s more coming. “Today’s announcement represents the start ...”  Apparently at Treasury’s request, the taskforce sent the government a list of 70 projects requiring the fast-track treatment. These include many that are “stuck” in the planning system because, let’s be frank, people detest them. Meriton’s proposal for a clutch of towers up to 22 storeys at Little Bay Cove, Bilbergia’s 440-apartment development at St Leonards, Mirvac’s proposal for West Pennant Hills and Walker Corp’s $16 billion proposal for 4000 dwellings in the Greater Macarthur Growth Area. Stokes is a nice guy. He’s also the pretty face for the much more ruthless Dominic Perrottet, whose agency – says the Urban Task Force - has been “driving planning reform in NSW”. Trust them with such unchecked power if you dare. Hand the public interest to a government that has flogged or destroyed many of our finest public assets and developed public land with enthusiasm. I say, good luck with that. Elizabeth Farrelly is a Sydney-based columnist and author who holds a PhD in architecture and several international writing awards.

The Liberal MP for Bega and NSW Transport Minister, 46, almost lost his Malua Bay home during the summer bushfires. He has since become an informal spokesman for communities affected by the disaster. Andrew Constance: ""Doubt is important. It’s important to doubt yourself because it gives you the ability to reflect on making sure what you are doing is right. If you don’t doubt yourself, you’re not human.""Credit: Jennifer Constance You were once NSW treasurer. What was that like?To be honest with you, it was a bit of an unnatural fit. I went from being disability services minister – where you’re able to really help people – to being locked up in meeting after meeting in the backrooms of government. Now, as NSW Transport Minister, you’ve been overseeing huge – often controversial – infrastructure projects, the costs of many of which have blown out.We’ve also delivered the Northwest Metro $1 billion under budget. Sydney’s new light rail was really hard for everybody – particularly residents and businesses – but I put in a program which delivered, on average, to successful businesses about $215,000 each to get them through. You deliver the reforms from Uber to taxis, to betterment strategies around the Opal public transport smartcard, but it’s a thankless task. How much does a NSW state MP get paid?There’s the base salary: around 150 or 160 grand. Then, on top of that, ministerial [wages] and allowances. Is it commensurate with the work you do?Well, one thing about politicians is that you have to do lots of things the community doesn’t see, particularly as a minister. You’ve said that you won’t be recontesting the next NSW state election. What’s Plan B? How will you make money post-politics?[Laughs] Money hasn’t really come into my thinking just yet. I was incredibly traumatised in January and February. I recently drove through some fire-affected areas after a funeral, and just couldn’t believe the level of destruction. It still shocks me. Now there’s the added devastation of coronavirus. That financial hit must be hard-felt in your electorate.From the moment the NSW South Coast bushfires started in the last week of November, people lost work. Casuals were laid off. Businesses folded. People were and are hurting. And it’s very hard for any politician at the moment – it doesn’t matter if it’s the prime minister or the premier – to be able to stand with confidence, to tell people there’s a pathway out of this. Are you a man of faith?I was baptised Anglican and then confirmed Anglican when I was a teenager. Is Anglican what you tick on the census now?Oh, yeah. I’m just not one who goes to church every Sunday. But you believe in God?I believe, but it’s not my place in political life to bring religion into everyday politics. Most Australians believe that it’s a private matter. That’s very much how I see it. Has what’s happened to you, your family and the community you live in over the past few months shaken your faith at all?I haven’t thought about it like that. I’ve seen so much pain, but I don’t sort of wake up every morning and question my faith, when the practicalities of pain are there for everyone. On the flip side of belief is doubt. When you’re a politician, is doubt an asset or a liability?Doubt is important. It’s important to doubt yourself because it gives you the ability to reflect on making sure what you are doing is right. If you don’t doubt yourself, you’re not human. Outside of religion, what keeps you grounded?Strong friendships. The bushfires reset a number of relationships for me, and I’ve found incredible solace in people I wasn’t close to before. Rob and Jen across the road, Steve and Mandy; I’ve formed lifelong bonds with my neighbours. They’ve gone from being neighbours you’d say g’day to over the fence to lifelong friends who I care about deeply. It feels like death has permeated our whole conversation already, given that so many homes in your electorate were destroyed by the fires.Yeah, around the 950 mark. You know, the morning the fire came through, I thought I was gone. There were a couple of occasions that day when I honestly thought, “I’m not gonna live past today.” None of us is immortal. The fires burned right up to the front of your house. You’ve spoken frankly about living with trauma and grief as a result. What is helping you manage?In 2011, I had a head-on car accident. During that experience, I honestly thought it was over for my former wife and our four-year-old in the car. I had significant post-traumatic stress after that, so I do know that you can come out of it. But you can only come out with the right help. Now, for thousands of people, [counselling services] are completely on hold, even though it’s not the type of thing you can put on hold. We’ve got people lifting shattered pieces from the fire and unable to get the necessary support. The virus couldn’t have come at a worse time for healing. Have these near-death experiences made you more or less afraid of the idea that you’ll die one day?It’s had an interesting effect. I have zero filters towards political work now. It’s probably been the healthiest thing that could happen. People in the community can sense emotional detachment, so this is all forcing community and business leaders to become grounded again. What’s your advice for people experiencing grief and trauma, whether through the fires or coronavirus?It’s all about connection and kindness. It doesn’t take much to pick up the phone and have a yak to someone. Even though we’ve got to maintain distance physically, emotional connection is really important because we’re all scared.

""I'm a teacher and so I really struggled with not having a schedule at first so I needed something like this because it gave me a plan to work with,"" Ms Bunting said. The Berejiklian government will boost funding to Tresillian to ensure free access to the app as part of its $73 million COVID-19 mental health package to be announced on Friday. It comes as the federal government announced on Thursday night $6 million in additional funding will be divided between online and phone drug and alcohol support services. In NSW, more than 180 mental health workers will be deployed as part of its package to bolster mental health services during the pandemic. There will be capacity for an extra 60,000 calls in the next 12 months to the 1800 NSW Mental Health Line and the creation of pop-up mental health Safe Space sites to reduce pressure on emergency departments. Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Mental Health Minister Bronnie Taylor said the funding will help support the mental health and wellbeing of people across the state. Ms Berejiklian said the extra mental health staff and new digital resources would ensure anyone who requires support was able to access it. ""We know how challenging the past few months have been.

""During this time it is vital we deliver robust mental health services that fit the evolving needs of the community - this means employing more frontline workers and greater investment in remote technology."" Mrs Taylor said the NSW government's measures complement federal mental health plans and enhance the ability to support people in their homes rather than in hospitals.

NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman confirmed on Thursday he has requested the advice from the Department of Communities and Justice about a ban, which follows a flag being displayed from a Newtown home at the weekend. The NSW government is looking to ban Nazi flags after a swastika was flown on a Newtown house at the weekend.  ""These symbols of hatred and anti-Semitism are unacceptable anywhere in our community,"" Mr Speakman said. ""They are deeply offensive and capable of traumatising survivors of genocide and their loved ones. The small but disgraceful minority who display these images insult the memory of the millions of victims of the Holocaust and those who died defending the world from this hatred."" Labor frontbencher Walt Secord, who is also deputy chair of the NSW Parliamentary Friends of Israel group, urged the government to consider a ban and Liberal MP for Vaucluse Gabrielle Upton wrote to Mr Speakman on Monday. In her letter, Ms Upton asked Mr Speakman to ""identify the best ways the government can end this totally offensive and deplorable use of the Nazi flag"". A swastika was painted over a mural along Bondi Beach's promenade last year. Credit:Australian Jewish News Mr Secord said he welcomed the move by Mr Speakman, saying while he wanted the flag ban it should go through the proper process and be referred to the Attorney-General's department. ""The Nazi flag is deeply offensive to veterans who fought against fascism and was an affront to survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants,"" Mr Secord said. ""The Nazi flag is an emblem of genocide and racism."" Mr Secord, who is an associate member of the Emanuel Synagogue in Woollahra, said recent incidents which include a swastika painted at Bondi Beach and physical attacks on a person on the way to prayer were symbols of a ""despicable shift in our community"". ""The decision to fly a Nazi flag is a simple expression of hatred,"" he said. The NSW government introduced race hate laws in 2018. People who incite or threaten violence against anyone on the grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation or HIV status face a three-year jail term and $11,000 fine. Mr Speakman said anyone affected by this conduct should contact police and urged anyone who believed they have been vilified to also contact Anti-Discrimination NSW and lodge a complaint.

Labor frontbencher Walt Secord, who is also deputy chair of the NSW Parliamentary Friends of Israel group, urged the government to consider a ban and Liberal MP for Vaucluse Gabrielle Upton wrote to Mr Speakman on Monday. In her letter, Ms Upton asked Mr Speakman to ""identify the best ways the government can end this totally offensive and deplorable use of the Nazi flag"". A swastika was painted over a mural along Bondi Beach's promenade last year. Credit:Australian Jewish News Mr Secord said he welcomed the move by Mr Speakman, saying while he wanted the flag ban it should go through the proper process and be referred to the Attorney-General's department. ""The Nazi flag is deeply offensive to veterans who fought against fascism and was an affront to survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants,"" Mr Secord said. ""The Nazi flag is an emblem of genocide and racism."" Mr Secord, who is an associate member of the Emanuel Synagogue in Woollahra, said recent incidents which include a swastika painted at Bondi Beach and physical attacks on a person on the way to prayer were symbols of a ""despicable shift in our community"". ""The decision to fly a Nazi flag is a simple expression of hatred,"" he said. The NSW government introduced race hate laws in 2018. People who incite or threaten violence against anyone on the grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation or HIV status face a three-year jail term and $11,000 fine. Mr Speakman said anyone affected by this conduct should contact police and urged anyone who believed they have been vilified to also contact Anti-Discrimination NSW and lodge a complaint.

When his day in court arrived on January 30, 2009 the young man said he was bewildered when Croke, at the bar table, nodded to him to plead guilty to the new charges. Despite expressing his shock at what had happened in court that day, Croke assured him it would all be fine. ""I’ve been doing this for over 20 years … don’t worry, you will only get a slap on the wrist,"" his solicitor said. But the young man didn’t get a slap on the wrist - he was jailed for two-and-a-half years. In 2010 he told the NSW Court of Appeal he had not read or signed the statement of facts. ""I would never have agreed to what it said as it was not true,"" he said. In a scathing assessment of Croke, appeal court judge Anthony Whealy said that ""at no time"" had the man been shown the agreed statement of facts, nor were they explained to him. ""Mr Croke, of course, insisted that they were. It is significant, however, that Mr Croke was unable to produce notes of any conference that he had ever had."" Nor could the solicitor produce any written instructions relating to the plea, Justice Whealy said. Ordering the convictions be quashed and the young man be released without the delay, Justice Whealy said the episode had been a ""serious miscarriage of justice"". Croke subsequently received a ""reprimand"" from the Law Society for, among other things, failing to explain to his client what he was pleading guilty to. This was not the first time the judiciary had had reason to be concerned about Croke’s unprofessional conduct. In 1999 District Court Judge Joe Phelan was furious when Croke failed to turn up on the first day of his client’s trial, causing a three-month delay. Judge Phelan noted that Croke had done this before. The judge advised the accused to find someone else to represent him. One of Croke’s own co-accused, music promoter Andrew McManus, had previously sued him for professional negligence. McManus, who was sentenced to a 20-month intensive corrections order over his role in lying to police over the $702,000, gave evidence at Croke's trial that the solicitor had coached him on his fabricated version of events.

Mario Henry Aliverti, 61, assaulted six boys while he occupied leadership roles at a Scout group in south-west Sydney between 1985 and 1989. One boy was abused again by Aliverti in 1991. Mario Henry Aliverti leaves court in 2018.Credit:Georgina Mitchell Those boys, who were aged between 11 and 15, were subjected to a range of persistent assaults including being masturbated against their will, being touched indecently, and having Aliverti penetrate them, causing significant pain. One of the boys, aged 12, was assaulted so forcefully he developed a friction burn on his penis. He was assaulted again at age 13, sustaining another penis burn which bled, after Aliverti invited him to build canoes in a Scout building and instead pushed him down and assaulted him while he cried. He later attempted to take his own life. Aliverti's Scout membership was terminated in 1990 after one of the boys told his teacher what happened. No charges were laid at the time, after the boy's family were told by a Scout commissioner to ""think twice"" because police might charge them with neglect. The victims made police complaints between 2016 and 2018. After the Scouts, Aliverti gained access to three other boys whom he assaulted between 1993 and 2007. One, who was assaulted at age 7, was in the same bed as Aliverti and pretended to be asleep as Aliverti pressed against him and put his mouth on him. Aliverti claimed in a police interview, years later, that the child moved in his direction during the night ""and when I woke up his penis was in my mouth"". Aliverti pleaded guilty last year to 12 offences including sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10, aggravated indecent assault and gross indecency. On Thursday, NSW District Court Judge Jane Culver jailed Aliverti for a maximum of 31 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 21 years. Six of his victims watched on as the sentence was delivered. In harrowing victim impact statements, one said the abuse has stayed with him for 30 years. Another said he was ""powerless to stop it"". ""I want all of the memories erased,"" the man said. ""[He] stole my innocence, my dreams and my soul."" Another victim said he drinks heavily, cries randomly and lives with depression. ""Nothing has been more mentally scarring than being molested as a child by someone I trusted,"" he said. Aliverti said in a letter to the court there is ""no excuse"" for his actions, ""which were carried out perhaps when I was morally immature."" He was aged between 25 and 46 when he committed the offences. In a statement, Scouts NSW said the organisation worked closely with police while Aliverti was investigated and the sentence ""reflects the severity of his crimes"". ""The safety and protection of children in our care is our number one priority,"" Scouts NSW chief executive Jane Siebum said. ""Scouts has a national child protection policy which immediately reports any and all suspicious behaviour to appropriate authorities."" Judge Culver said the trauma from child sex abuse is very real and typically permeates ""every aspect"" of victims' lives. She said people assaulted as children can find it difficult to bring forward such confusing allegations, ""where they themselves somehow feel shamed although they deserve no sense of shame.""

Mr Elias, 53, was driving along Victoria Rd, Drummoyne on Friday March 6 when another car collided with the back of his vehicle in an alleged staged accident. Party boat operator Joe Elias, centre, in October 2019.Credit:Yianni Aspradakis The cars turned into the nearest cross street and Mr Elias exited his vehicle to assess the damage, before two men from the other car physically assaulted him. It is alleged the men tried to pick up Mr Elias by his hands and feet and carry him into their Toyota Hilux, however he managed to escape and run to the nearest cross street. The two men allegedly tried to leave the area in their car, before fleeing on foot. A large number of witnesses and passersby observed the brazen attempt on Edwin St, which took place around 4pm. Police allege the plan of the assailants was to stage the crash, kidnap Mr Elias and hold him for ransom. Mr Elias is the owner of All Occasion Cruises, which hit headlines when the body of a 39-year-old woman was found in a toilet cubicle on a party boat after she was fatally overcome by toxic gases in March last year. When contacted by the Herald Mr Elias confirmed there had been an incident on March 6, but declined to comment further while a police investigation is under way. On Thursday Martin Radat, 23, and David Ninip, 27, were arrested in early morning raids at homes in Fairfield and Glenmore Park. It is alleged they were the two men responsible for the attempted kidnapping, which was planned by a group of individuals. Detective Acting Superintendent Grant Taylor, Commander of the Robbery and Serious Organised Crime Squad, said the men were the latest to be arrested in connection with a number of recent kidnappings, some of which have involved the alleged torture of victims. ""Kidnappings are not an unusual event ... we have had a spate of them in the last several months,"" he said. ""It is usually very large sums of money ... demanded of those people who have been kidnapped."" He said in most of the recent kidnappings the victim has suffered ""some form of torture."" The men arrested on Thursday have been charged with attempting to detain in company with intent to get advantage, occasioning actual bodily harm and other offences. Police believe the incident may be linked to a similar attempt in November, when a 36-year-old man was allegedly assaulted with a firearm and kidnapped by two men at a workshop on Links Road, St Marys. The man was located the following day suffering injuries in a shed on a property at Shanes Park, in western Sydney. He was discovered by three members of the public and taken to hospital in a critical condition with a fractured skull. He has since been released from hospital. Police have already charged three men, aged 36, 39 and 40, over the alleged incident. They remain before the courts. Detective Acting Superintendent Taylor said police believe there was a ""core"" group of individuals responsible for the March and November incidents, but different individuals were used at different times to carry out the kidnappings. Another three men - aged 25, 46 and 51 - were also charged on Thursday over a series of unrelated alleged kidnappings, extortions, firearms and drug-related offences.

Police have already charged three men, aged 36, 39 and 40, over the alleged incident. They remain before the courts. Detective Acting Superintendent Taylor said police believe there was a ""core"" group of individuals responsible for the March and November incidents, but different individuals were used at different times to carry out the kidnappings. Another three men - aged 25, 46 and 51 - were also charged on Thursday over a series of unrelated alleged kidnappings, extortions, firearms and drug-related offences.

The tale commenced on the evening of August 11, 2011, when police were alerted that the occupant of room 3206 at the upmarket Hilton Hotel had a gun. Carolan did not have a gun, but he was wheeling an overnight bag containing $702,000 in cash. Earlier that day a professional gambler and hired money launderer, Robert Cipriani, also known as Robin Hood 702 (the Las Vegas phone area code) had blown $2.5 million in cash he was meant to be laundering at the Star Casino for international drug trafficker Owen Hanson. Nicknamed ""O-Dog"", Hanson is serving a 21-year jail term in California for drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering. Professional gambler Robert Cipriani, also known as Robin Hood 702, is alleged to have laundered money in Sydney's Star casino.  Hanson, a former US Olympic volleyball player, had imported 100 kilograms of cocaine into Australia and was laundering the proceeds by having Cipriani convert the cash into gambling chips, play black jack, then have the remaining chips converted into a cheque that would be redeemed at a Las Vegas casino. Cipriani, whose business class airfares to Sydney had been paid for by Hanson, had already received a handsome payment for previously laundering $1.5 million for Hanson. However on this day, Cipriani blew the lot. CCTV footage showed Hanson, accompanied by Carolan, in a heated confrontation with Cipriani at the casino.  After promising to hand over his passport, Cipriani promptly caught a taxi to the airport and bolted. But not before making the call about the gun that was to bring them all undone. That night Carolan provided to the police the bare bones of the story, saying that he hadn’t looked inside the bag but that Hanson had blown a lot of money at the casino and he had asked Carolan to mind the rest for him so he wouldn’t lose more. He also told police that Hanson was intending to invest some of the cash in Carolan's weight-loss business. Craig Haeusler (left) with Owen Hanson in Sydney in 2011. The following day, organised crime figure Craig Haeusler made a dramatic entry into the cast of characters via convicted fraudster Brad Cooper, who’d been out of jail for only a year after serving five years for bribing a former HIH executive and making false statements. Cooper knew just the person Hanson needed: Haeusler, a major organised crime figure who has business links to bikie bosses and other underworld identities. Haeusler arranged for Croke to represent the criminal group in their ill-fated attempt to convince the police that Hanson’s seized money was legitimate. Croke was less than complimentary about his client Carolan telling Haeusler: ""He’s a shitbag, I don’t know how you f--kin' find these c---s, I’m tellin' ya.""

The scheme to lie about the seized money was hatched with Haeusler at a lunch at the China Doll restaurant in Woolloomooloo in March 2012. McManus denied he was drunk at the lunch but agreed he had consumed cocaine. ""One or two lines, not much,"" he offered.

Wollongong executive leadership will take a 20 per cent pay cut for 12 months and freeze non-essential external recruitment. Professor Glover said WSU would compensate by increasing domestic student numbers and reducing expenditure, including by cutting its casual budget in semester two while courses were predominantly delivered online.

34,/national/nsw/teaching-has-been-a-lifelong-vocation-for-this-headmaster-20200422-p54m5m.html,Teaching has been a lifelong vocation for this headmaster,"John Collier's passion for English literature and history led him into a lifelong career in teaching. The headmaster of St Andrew's Cathedral School in the Sydney CBD studied English, history and government at the University of Sydney before doing a diploma of education. He has been teaching for 48 years. St Andrews' principal Dr John Collier. Credit:Louie Douvis ""I never wanted to be anything else,"" he said. ""It arose initially out of my love for English and history and my growing understanding that I could have a great rapport with young people and this was a calling and vocation."" After completing his practical teacher training at Sydney Grammar School when a young Malcolm Turnbull was one of the students, his first teaching job after graduation was at Lurnea High School in Liverpool as an English and history teacher, starting in 1973. The Sydney Grammar experience and his school years at James Ruse High had shown him the heights that gifted students could reach, but he was not prepared for his first job in the public school system. ""I was ill prepared,"" he said. ""I went from experiencing only an elite school to a disadvantaged school in the western suburbs. I went from teaching highly able kids at Sydney Grammar School to an allocation where I had the 13th graded class down in English in Year 9, so it was a rude awakening to the realities of normal teaching. ""I learnt a great deal very quickly. I needed to in order to survive and I had seven wonderful years there. I loved the kids and was sad to eventually leave."" From Lurnea, he went to Leumeah High School in the Campbelltown area before being promoted to  head of history at another western Sydney school, Busby High. He then moved on to Macquarie Fields High, Elderslie High and at the age of 39, became the youngest state high school principal at Thomas Reddall High School in Campbelltown. ""Because I came from a very dysfunctional family myself, I have always had a great rapport with students who are struggling or who are from difficult family circumstances,"" he said. ""I have found that very helpful in the role of principal and head of school in understanding and helping care for those kinds of students."" After 25 years in the public system he was appointed principal of St Paul’s Grammar School in Penrith, where he worked for 12 years before taking his current job in 2010. St Paul's had been the second school in the state to introduce the International Baccalaureate Diploma and Dr Collier was responsible for extending that program from senior to junior and middle years. Mandarin was compulsory from kindergarten to year 6. It was then taken up by years 7 to 12. ""St Paul's had the largest Mandarin Chinese teaching program in Australia at that time,"" he said. He is now in his 11th year as head of St Andrew's Cathedral School and its Aboriginal school, Gawura. Dr Collier is a huge advocate of Australia's youth, describing them as ""magnificent"". ""They give me great hope for the future,"" he said. While Dr Collier has no interest in changing careers, he says the management and administrative skills a headmaster develops are transferable to chief executive officer roles in the commercial world. He says teaching is a wonderful career for those who love people and want to make a difference. ""It is not a career that is ever going to make you wealthy,"" he said. ""But it is ... one of the critical areas of society because it is preparing young people for the future. ""Most principals would tell you the workload is immense and they deal sometimes with very challenging issues, but they love the work and they are glad they have the role. ""I'd encourage people to look at headship and not be overwhelmed by a sense of the workload, because it is a great opportunity to make a difference."" Dr Collier recommended specialisation in a subject at honours or Masters level, or taking a Masters in Educational Leadership or an MBA or PhD.

35,/national/nsw/premier-accuses-teachers-union-of-wanting-kids-home-indefinitely-20200423-p54moi.html,Premier accuses teachers' union of wanting kids home indefinitely,"Premier Gladys Berejiklian has accused the NSW Teachers Federation of wanting to keep children home from school indefinitely, while the Education Minister says the union's proposal to return year 12 to school before other grades forgets that every child's education should be equally valued. The public stoush has erupted between the government and the federation over the government's plan to bring all public school students back to class for one day a week from May 11, bringing to the surface weeks of tension over how to transition back to full-time, face-to-face schooling. The question over closing schools has been the ""messiest part"" of the state's coronavirus response.Credit:Andrew Quilty The NSW Teachers Federation has been highly critical of the government's one-day-a-week plan, saying it ""beggars belief"" and fails to comprehend the massive logistical challenges it would cause. Some high-profile principals and teachers have also been arguing on social media that sending students back at all would put teachers' safety at risk. However, many parents are struggling with the pressure of supervising lessons at home while working full-time. The federation's position is that kindergarten and year 12 should return first, when it is safe to do so. Catholic Schools NSW, the P&C Federation and some independent schools have also said they would prefer year 12 to return first. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian.Credit:AAP Ms Berejiklian on Thursday defended the government's plan to gradually return all students to school, beginning with one day a week from May 11, then increasing that to two days towards the end of term two, then beginning full-time class teaching in term three. ""The union has its view, but we vigorously oppose it,"" she told Nine Radio on Thursday. ""The union's position would be to have the children remaining online indefinitely and we don't think that's viable, which is why we are doing what we are doing."" In an opinion piece for the Herald, Ms Mitchell said the proposal to bring back year 12 first was a ""suggestion from those who have forgotten that we must value the education of every child equally. In some cases, it is people who shroud their reluctance to have any child attend school while there is a pandemic behind clever rhetoric."" To allow only year 12 students to return first, ""leaves a significant portion of our school students at risk of not seeing their teachers for an entire term or potentially more,"" Ms Mitchell wrote. ""Many of these students are also in a crucial time at school, where they develop the formative skills needed to achieve when it is their turn for the HSC."" The president of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the premier's comment was ""demonstrably untrue"", as the union offered its proposal for a staged return to school two weeks ago. He said the statement from Ms Mitchell was also ""most regrettable"". ""It is confrontational, noting teachers and principals have turned themselves inside out during the crisis, it is an affront and will create resentment,"" Mr Gavrielatos said. ""The Teachers Federation has sought to engage constructively with the government about a staggered orderly return of students to schools to coincide with an easing of restrictions on gathering and movement."" It comes as private schools plan their own return-to-school strategies in the wake of the government's announcement. St Catherine's School in Waverley plans to bring all students back to campus between week three and week six. In the junior school, kindergarten and year four will return first, and in the senior school, year 11 and 12 will be first. Different year groups will be added each week, and the boarding house will be open. Parents will be asked to stay off the school grounds, and girls will have their temperatures checked. ""I also wish to clarify that the four-metre, two-person-to-person rule in an enclosed space applies to adults, such as teachers in a staff room,"" said principal Julie Townsend. ""It does not apply to students in classrooms. We will, of course, do whatever is practicable."" SCEGGS Darlinghurst will bring back year 12 from May 11, while girls from across all year groups will attend for one day a week. In a letter to parents, St Andrews Cathedral School Principal John Collier said he was still working on the school's strategy, but ""we are examining ways to give particular priority to year 12, and ways to allow onto site those who need to work on physical major projects as part of their HSC"".

38,/national/nsw/terrible-situation-fourth-death-as-nursing-home-struggles-with-staffing-20200423-p54mnp.html,'Terrible situation': fourth death as nursing home struggles with staffing,"A fourth resident has died from COVID-19 at Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney, as the facility's operator says it remains understaffed despite federal government assistance. A 79-year-old woman with multiple serious health issues died early on Thursday morning, operator Anglicare confirmed. The facility near Penrith has the largest coronavirus cluster outside of the Ruby Princess ship. Replay   ""I have talked directly to the immediate family of the resident and conveyed our sincerest condolences,” Anglicare Sydney CEO Grant Millard said on Thursday afternoon. ""Every death of one of our residents is always difficult for our staff, other residents, their family, and our extended Anglicare family. ""We sincerely appreciate everyone’s thoughts and prayers during this terrible situation."" There have been 44 cases of COVID-19 linked to Newmarch House, which is part of Anglicare's Caddens Village, after a staff member worked for six days while infectious earlier this month. The coroner leaves Anglicare's Newmarch House aged care facility at Caddens on Thursday.Credit:Rhett Wyman Fifteen staff and 29 residents, four of whom are deceased, have tested positive. The 25 residents are being treated through the Nepean-Blue Mountains Local Health District's ""hospital in the home"" program. Although the program provides a daily visit from NSW Health doctors and nurses, it does not extend to daily living support, which is the responsibility of Anglicare, a spokesperson for the district said. Mr Millard said the facility was still struggling with staff shortages after the outbreak forced 55 of its regular staff to self-isolate due to either contracting or being exposed to the coronavirus. The facility operated with less than two-thirds of its usual staff numbers on Wednesday, despite the efforts of the federal government and employment agencies to find additional carers. Family members of patients have reported long wait times for care, with one woman saying her grandmother had to wait two hours after pressing her buzzer for help with respiratory problems. In a statement, Anglicare said the process of dressing in full personal protective equipment, additional hygiene practices and maintaining social distance meant it was taking staff at least five times longer to deliver ""the care [their] residents and their families expect"". A video call between family members of residents, Mr Millard, Nepean Hospital's Dr James Branley and a federal Department of Health representative was scheduled for Thursday evening. ""The purpose of this conference is to communicate with family members ... about the issues we have faced to date and the measures that have and will continue to be implemented across the home,"" an email sent to family members on Thursday read. ""We appreciate and understand why families are upset, frustrated and disappointed,"" Mr Millard said. On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said the federal government was providing additional staff for the facility, as well as protective equipment and testing services from private provider Sonic.

A Sydney Adventist Hospital nurse and a paramedic from the Liverpool Ambulance superstation were among the five coronavirus cases confirmed in NSW on Thursday, which NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said was ""one of the best results we've had"". NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian speaks to the media during a press conference in Sydney on Thursday morning. Credit:AAP ""We know that these restrictions that we've had in place are working,"" she said.​ A worker and resident from western Sydney aged care facility Newmarch House were among the new confirmed cases. There have now been 44 confirmed cases linked to the home, 15 staff and 29 residents. On Thursday, the national death toll rose to 76 after a 79-year-old woman became the fourth resident from the facility to die. With just 12 new cases of COVID-19 confirmed nationally, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth said the country was doing an extraordinary job in suppressing the virus and eradication from particular areas could be a possibility. ""I think we are on a strategy of suppression, [but] a magnificent outcome would be geographic eradication in certain parts of Australia,"" he said. Since the virus first surfaced in NSW, 59 healthcare workers including doctors, nurses, paramedics and allied health staff have tested positive for COVID-19. That number does not include aged care workers, who are not employed by NSW Health. Those cases made up just 0.04 per cent of the more than 140,000 healthcare workers employed across the state’s public health system, a NSW Health spokeswoman said. The nurse, from the Sydney Adventist Hospital, had worked in the hospital’s COVID-19 isolation ward two days before becoming unwell. A spokeswoman for Sydney Adventist Hospital said the nurse did not work while sick, but they had worked one shift on the ward in the 48 hours before they developed symptoms. Medical experts believe people may be infectious during that period. ""Two days later, when symptoms suddenly became apparent, despite having a normal range temperature when checked on arrival at work, prior to commencing, the nurse was immediately sent home for testing,"" the spokeswoman said. ""It is unknown if the virus was contracted in the hospital or in the community."" Five close contacts of the nurse have been identified and are self isolating, however the hospital spokeswoman did not say whether those contacts included other staff or patients. NSW Health said there was no ongoing risk. ""The hospital has had health screening checks including temperature testing for all staff at the start of each shift for several weeks and similar processes for all doctors and hospital visitors,"" the spokeswoman said. ""All personal protective equipment protocols are being followed."" The paramedic, who is being treated in hospital, is the first paramedic in the state to be diagnosed with COVID-19, NSW Ambulance confirmed. Health Services Union secretary Gerard Hayes said the risk of COVID-19 infection added another layer of stress to the job of paramedics as potential exposure to the disease was a ""risk of every job they do"". ""COVID-19 is a serious virus, but it does not stop the fact people are still having heart attacks, having strokes, and car accidents,"" he said. ""The day-to-day life of paramedics continues, and this is just another level of proactive focus they need to bring to their job.""
