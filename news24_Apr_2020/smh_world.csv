The findings, based on 166 sets of data covering 1676 sites in 41 countries dating as far back as 1925, provided a nuanced assessment for insects, the most ubiquitous and diverse animals on the planet. An insect flies next to a flower in Erfurt, Germany.Credit:AP Insects such as mosquitoes - which live in the water as larvae - as well as midges, mayflies, water beetles and caddisflies that spend at least part of their lives in freshwater were found to have experienced a population increase of about 11 per cent per decade. Freshwater covers only about 2.5 per cent of the Earth's surface, so the vast majority of insects live on land. Other bugs are disappearing at a rate of just under 1 per cent a year, with lots of variation from place to place, according to the study published in the journal Science. That's a tinier population decline than found by some smaller localised studies, which had triggered fears of a so-called insect apocalypse. But it still adds up to something ""awfully alarming"", said entomologist Roel van Klink of the German Centre for Integrative Biology, the study's lead author. An invasive brown marmorated stink bug. Credit:DPI ""The decline across insect orders on land is jaw dropping,"" said Michigan State University butterfly expert Nick Haddad, who wasn't part of the study. ""Ongoing decline on land at this rate will be catastrophic for ecological systems and for humans. Insects are pollinators, natural enemies of pests, decomposers and besides that, are critical to functioning of all Earth's ecosystems."" The number of insects on average has declined in the air, in the grass and on the soil surface, but not in trees or underground, the researchers found. Projecting the trends into the future shows that land-dwelling insects would sustain a population drop of 24 per cent over 30 years while the freshwater bugs would experience a 38 per cent increase over the same period. ""Insects are a central part of almost all ecosystems because they stand in the middle between the plants they eat and the animals that eat insects, like birds, bats and lizards,"" van Klink said. ""They also impact our own lives, often in ways we don't think about. Insects pollinate many of our crops, and without them we would have no fruits and no flowers. But at the same time, insects transmit terrible diseases like malaria, Zika and West Nile virus, they eat our crops and damage tree plantations,"" van Klink added. The study did not break down the findings by species. There was scant data from South Asia and the Middle East, and limited data from Africa.  The strongest declines were documented in the mid-western United States and in Germany. The researchers credited clean-water policies instituted in recent decades for the increase in freshwater bugs. They attributed the declines in land-dwelling insects to human activities such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, urbanisation, light pollution and chemical pollution, while saying insecticides and increased droughts due to climate change may also have played a role.

8,/world/africa/jump-in-cases-raises-fears-africa-could-become-new-centre-of-pandemic-20200424-p54mtl.html,Jump in cases raises fears Africa could become new centre of pandemic,"Cape Town: Africa registered a 43 per cent jump in reported COVID-19 cases in the last week, highlighting a warning from the World Health Organisation that the continent of 1.3 billion could become the next hotspot of the global outbreak. Health workers collects samples for coronavirus testing outside a shack to combat the spread of COVID-19 at Lenasia South, Johannesburg, South Africa.Credit:AP Africa also has a ""very, very limited"" and ""very, very strained"" testing capacity, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said in his weekly briefing on Thursday. The surge in infections on the continent is almost certainly under-reported and even higher in reality, say medical experts. WHO's recent report painted a grim picture for Africa, one of the last continents to be hit by the pandemic. WHO warned the virus could kill more than 300,000 people and push 30 million into desperate poverty. Africa still has time to avert such a disaster, Nkengasong said, but testing people and tracing virus cases is critical. South African National Defence Forces patrol in Johannesburg as residents  protest against the lack of food. Many have lost their income after a strict five-week lockdown in an effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Credit:AP ""It all depends on what we are discussing here, which is, are you testing? Are you finding the cases? Are you isolating and tracking the contacts?"" Nkengasong said, adding that the WHO report ""is not a prediction that means it must happen."" By Nkengasong's own criteria, Africa is struggling on the testing front. In the two months since the continent began mobilising to fight the outbreak, less than 500,000 tests have been conducted on the population of more than 1 billion. That's just 325 people tested per 1 million people, Nkengasong said. That's far lower than Italy, for example, one of the world's worst-hit countries, he said. ""If you don't test, you don't find. And if you don't test, you are blinded. If you don't test, you are not ahead of the curve,"" Nkengasong said. African governments reported a total of nearly 26,000 cases as of Thursday, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, up from just over 16,000 a week ago. Around 1200 people have died. Although those figures are still relatively small in the global picture, the sharp increase in cases is a cause for concern, said Nkengasong. The previous week saw an increase of 29 per cent. The Africa Centres for Disease Control has a target of conducting 1 million more tests over the next four weeks and 10 million tests in the next four months. The overall effort is badly hampered, Nkengasong said, by a major obstacle: the existing fragility of the health services. ""I'd like to make sure I make this very clear,"" he said. ""It is an uphill battle to build health systems while you need them. ... That is what we are actually doing now. We are playing catch-up and that is a very, very tough thing to do."" South Africa has nearly 4000 reported cases, according to its Health Ministry, the highest in the continent. It also saw a big one-day jump of 318 new cases on Thursday and 75 people have now died. But Africa's most developed economy is being praised for an aggressive testing program. South Africa, aided by existing infrastructure, has carried out more than 140,000 tests, according to its health minister. And ""they are starting to see a bending of their curve."" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa. Their early and tentative signs of success - helped, maybe, by a strict lockdown - are being set off by ""concerning increases"" in virus cases in some countries in West Africa and East Africa, Moeti said.

Health workers collects samples for coronavirus testing outside a shack to combat the spread of COVID-19 at Lenasia South, Johannesburg, South Africa.Credit:AP Africa also has a ""very, very limited"" and ""very, very strained"" testing capacity, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said in his weekly briefing on Thursday. The surge in infections on the continent is almost certainly under-reported and even higher in reality, say medical experts. WHO's recent report painted a grim picture for Africa, one of the last continents to be hit by the pandemic. WHO warned the virus could kill more than 300,000 people and push 30 million into desperate poverty. Africa still has time to avert such a disaster, Nkengasong said, but testing people and tracing virus cases is critical. South African National Defence Forces patrol in Johannesburg as residents  protest against the lack of food. Many have lost their income after a strict five-week lockdown in an effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Credit:AP ""It all depends on what we are discussing here, which is, are you testing? Are you finding the cases? Are you isolating and tracking the contacts?"" Nkengasong said, adding that the WHO report ""is not a prediction that means it must happen."" By Nkengasong's own criteria, Africa is struggling on the testing front. In the two months since the continent began mobilising to fight the outbreak, less than 500,000 tests have been conducted on the population of more than 1 billion. That's just 325 people tested per 1 million people, Nkengasong said. That's far lower than Italy, for example, one of the world's worst-hit countries, he said. ""If you don't test, you don't find. And if you don't test, you are blinded. If you don't test, you are not ahead of the curve,"" Nkengasong said. African governments reported a total of nearly 26,000 cases as of Thursday, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, up from just over 16,000 a week ago. Around 1200 people have died. Although those figures are still relatively small in the global picture, the sharp increase in cases is a cause for concern, said Nkengasong. The previous week saw an increase of 29 per cent. The Africa Centres for Disease Control has a target of conducting 1 million more tests over the next four weeks and 10 million tests in the next four months. The overall effort is badly hampered, Nkengasong said, by a major obstacle: the existing fragility of the health services. ""I'd like to make sure I make this very clear,"" he said. ""It is an uphill battle to build health systems while you need them. ... That is what we are actually doing now. We are playing catch-up and that is a very, very tough thing to do."" South Africa has nearly 4000 reported cases, according to its Health Ministry, the highest in the continent. It also saw a big one-day jump of 318 new cases on Thursday and 75 people have now died. But Africa's most developed economy is being praised for an aggressive testing program. South Africa, aided by existing infrastructure, has carried out more than 140,000 tests, according to its health minister. And ""they are starting to see a bending of their curve."" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa. Their early and tentative signs of success - helped, maybe, by a strict lockdown - are being set off by ""concerning increases"" in virus cases in some countries in West Africa and East Africa, Moeti said.

10,/world/europe/britain-has-a-credible-opposition-again-and-just-in-time-too-20200423-p54mdk.html,"Britain has a credible opposition again. And just in time, too","London: Two things were obvious after the House of Commons wrapped up an unprecedented virtual sitting on Wednesday. First: the Johnson government skates worryingly close to empty-suit status when Boris Johnson is out of action. The Conservative Party needs its leader to recover from his coronavirus battle and get back to Downing Street pronto. Second and just as significant: Labour is back in Britain. And just in time, too. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has so far struck the right tone during the coronavirus emergency.Credit:AP In his first 15 minutes at the dispatch box as Opposition Leader, Sir Keir Starmer - whose elevation to the Labour leadership in early April was overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic - demonstrated the kind of political instinct and emotional intelligence his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn had zero capacity to achieve. George Osborne, the chancellor under former prime minister David Cameron, gave this verdict: ""After a five-year absence, Britain has an opposition again."" Osborne won't be the only Tory who thinks that. Starmer's contrast with Corbyn – a hero of the far-left who frequently misread the public mood and whose hatred for his political opponents so often damaged attempts to hold the government to account – could not have been sharper. Starmer pushed hard in his debut appearance but his tone was pitch-perfect given the gravity of the crisis. Drawing on his background as a former director of public prosecutions, Starmer mounted a forensic examination of the government's response to the outbreak, with a particular focus on Britain's testing regime. While other countries such as Germany and Australia deployed widespread testing, Britain only offered COVID-19 tests if someone was in hospital. Downing Street now realises that was a mistake and has a goal of expanding the scheme and conducting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. But how would the goal be achieved when only 18,000 tests were done on Tuesday, Starmer asked? The response was a huge own-goal. Avoiding the substance of the question, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab – who is filling in for Johnson – boasted that the government now had the capacity to conduct 40,000 tests a day. Sir Keir Starmer, seated, and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in Parliament on Wednesday.Credit:AP ""That is an incredibly important milestone,"" he offered. Starmer swooped: ""I think it is really important that we fully understand what he just said, because it means that ... 40,000 tests could have been carried out but only 18,000 tests were actually carried out."" That was the first in a series of direct hits the likes of which have rarely been seen in Westminster over recent years. The broad Labour movement now has a leader to rally behind after the turmoil and disappointment of the Corbyn experiment. Raab, by comparison, was a diminished figure by the end of the exchange. The ambitious 46-year-old has failed to impress as Britain's de facto acting prime minister. He lacks Johnson's inherent affinity with the public and has often been unable to answer basic questions Johnson would have handled with ease. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has deputised for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Credit:AP Confidence in another of the government's leading figures, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, is also waning. Hancock is at least across the detail of this complex policy challenge, however any failure to deliver on his promise of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April will seriously damage public confidence in the government. The 39-year-old Chancellor Rishi Sunak is winning praise but he is far too busy containing the economic fallout to be the public face of the overall response to the pandemic. Replay   Johnson was said to be watching Wednesday's parliamentary session while recovering at Chequers, the prime ministerial country retreat. A cunning and more skilled politician than critics give him credit for, Johnson will know the political game has changed. An opposition has arrived right when Britain needs it most.

11,/world/north-america/trump-joins-ostrich-alliance-of-loser-leaders-20200422-p54ma8.html,Trump joins 'Ostrich Alliance' of loser leaders,"Philadelphia: The Ostrich Alliance. That is the label a Brazilian professor from Sao Paulo applied to the leaders of Brazil, Belarus, Turkmenistan and Nicaragua who continue to deny the threat that the coronavirus poses to their people. All share a common disdain for science. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarussian, calls the disease a ""psychosis"" and refuses to impose social distancing. Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega calls it an ""act of God"". US President Donald Trump's buddy, Brazilian Jair Bolsonaro, downplays ""coronavirus hysteria"" and excoriates state governors as ""job killers"" for imposing quarantines. The author argues US President Donald Trump has joined the ""Ostrich Alliance"" by comparing him to, from left, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, and Belarussian Alexander Lukashenko.Credit:  In contrast to the ostrich club, the leaders who have been most successful in combating COVID-19, such as those of South Korea, Taiwan, and Germany, openly respect science and listen to their scientific advisers. Yet, Trump openly joined the Ostrich Alliance last week. Of course, Trump's disdain for science is no secret. The US is paying a high price for his weeks-long refusal to take COVID-19 seriously, despite many warnings. He promotes unproven drugs. And he refuses to institute a nationwide plan for antibody testing, which is a vital prerequisite for an economic restart. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, left, with his new Health Minister Nelson Teich, after firing Teich's predecessor over disagreements on how to handle the epidemic.Credit:Getty Images But last week, the President's war on science reached a fever pitch, as he egged on demonstrators who were protesting stay-at-home restrictions at several state capitals. In my weeks of covering this crisis worldwide, I have never seen anything so shameful. ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"" Trump tweeted. ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA!"" Both are states whose Democratic governors put strict social distancing regulations in place, as have Republican governors in Ohio, Maryland and elsewhere. ""They want their life back. Their life was taken away from them,"" Trump said at his April 19 briefing, as if health regulations were the enemy, not the virus. He was effectively urging demonstrators to ignore the back-to-work guidelines of his own taskforce, which require a two-week decline in cases before states start to reopen. Replay   That encourages reckless Republican governors such as Georgia's Brian Kemp, who just ordered the opening of nail salons, massage parlours, gyms, and other close-contact businesses, in violation of Trump's guidelines, without even consulting mayors. Meanwhile, the denigration of Democratic governors becomes Trump's tool to disguise his own failures. He styles himself a wartime commander in chief. Imagine if Winston Churchill had used his BBC speeches during the Blitz to attack the mayor of London rather than urge his people to stand firm against Adolf Hitler. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, take a break during a hockey game in Sochi, Russia. Credit:AP But nowhere is the President's ostrich-like behaviour more dangerous than in the matter of tests. 'Imagine if Winston Churchill had used his BBC speeches during the Blitz to attack the mayor of London rather than urge his people to stand firm against Adolf Hitler.' For weeks, Trump has misled the nation on the availability of testing for infected individuals, falsely claiming the United States was doing better at testing than other nations. Instead of co-ordinating the distribution of supplies at the national level − as South Korea and Germany did − Trump left governors from both parties struggling to obtain swabs and necessary chemicals and accurate test kits, in competition with each other. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, right, and Vice-President and first lady Rosario Murillo.Credit:AP Trump's response is to criticise governors and call them ignorant. (Perhaps he is jealous that polling shows all governors to be far more popular than he is.) Nor has the President yet grasped the criticality of ramping testing way, way up in order for Americans to return safely to work. Most important, say epidemiological experts, there needs to be a national strategy, both to co-ordinate supplies and personnel and to do a large-scale scientific sampling of the entire population for antibodies. This is necessary to finally understand the extent of the disease, including how many people had it but showed no symptoms, and who may now be immune. German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Credit:Getty Images Trump denies such a strategy is needed. He has fought Democratic requests for more money for testing. Germany, on the other hand, has already started conducting such a study, but then Chancellor Angela Merkel is herself a scientist. As for the United States, ""we are still totally, absolutely operating in the dark"", says Jennifer Pinto-Martin, executive director of the Centre for Public Health Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania. ""It is incomprehensible to send people back to work without accurate, consistent testing, contact tracing, and social distancing."" She adds that for testing to be effective, you need a ""consistent set of [national] testing protocols"", with a testing model that takes into account differences within states, along with age, gender and other factors. If each state goes off on its own, the overall results will be inconsistent, and we will remain ill-informed about the disease. But far from embracing science, Trump insists mass testing isn't necessary. It is more convenient for him to shift the burden to the states, even though that makes a safe return to work impossible. If some states reopen too soon (at his urging), Trump can also blame governors when the virus reemerges. We all want to get back to normal soonest. But it is unconscionable for Trump to abet the conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers, Second Amendment fanatics and conservative talk show hosts − along with many genuinely fearful citizens −who want to ignore the painful constrictions of science.

12,/world/europe/coronavirus-is-accelerating-eight-distributing-mega-trends-20200421-p54lnn.html,Coronavirus is accelerating eight challenging mega trends,"London: Our daily experience of the COVID-19 crisis is that it slows down our lives. Jobs are on hold, holidays not booked and travel unthinkable. We have more leisure time whether we like it or not. For people not on the healthcare frontline or essential supplies, the lockdown is a slowdown. Replay   Yet what is really happening is that the forces that will shape all our futures - the global tensions, the economic policies, the political ideas, the new technologies - are being sped up. Huge decisions and great controversies that might only have come to a head over the next couple of decades are suddenly upon us. We are about to experience the next 20 years in 12 months, and we need to get ready for it. A medical staff member adjusts her face mask as she arrives to start work at Dongsan Medical Centre in Daegu, South Korea.Credit:AP For an obvious example of this, take a look at the eurozone. Some of us have argued for years that it cannot work in its current form. To put it crudely, Italians will not work as productively as Germans, and Germans will not agree to pay off the debts of Italians. Without this crisis, such a fundamental chasm in the foundations of the euro would have continued to be a troubling but not imminent problem. Now it has yawned wide open. When Italy has looked north in its hour of need, it has found belated sympathy and precious little help. Suddenly, the EU faces an existential crisis. Or think about the drift to great power rivalry between America and China, already gathering pace in recent years. COVID-19 threatens to speed that up, with both countries trying to shift blame on to the other. In a US election year, candidates will vow to take a hard line on ensuring American technology is separated from that of China. Other Western capitals and company headquarters will conclude they cannot be dependent on supplies from one country in a world where borders close at the first hint of trouble. And so the process of ""deglobalisation"" - more of what we consume being made closer to home, even if it is more expensive - will accelerate. Instead of happening slowly as developments such as 3D printing change manufacturing techniques, it will happen quickly, driven on by political and security imperatives. The virus has strengthened existing trends: the crumbling US–China relationship has become more poisonous.Credit:AP Even so, the Asia-Pacific economies look likely to get through the coming months with considerably less damage than most in the West. They prepared for a pandemic that was like SARS, whereas we Westerners expected something more like Spanish flu, if we thought about it at all. So they have the ruthless quarantining and tracing systems to suppress the virus while we have the long agony of trying to live with it. As things stood, 2020 was already going to be the year in which Asia's GDP overtook the rest of the world combined. It was already going to account for 90 per cent of new middle-class people in the next decade. Perhaps we can revise that up to 95 per cent now. The Pacific century is going to arrive faster than anyone thought. It is not only in the West that we will experience a sudden fast-forwarding of what is to come. Countries dependent on oil production already faced forecasts that petroleum demand would peak and fall before 2030. Today they are receiving the sharpest possible demonstration of what that will mean, as oil prices plunge far below the point at which any of them can balance their budgets. The need for Saudi Arabia to diversify away from energy production just got starker, and the funds for doing it smaller. For others like Russia, living rather complacently on oil and gas revenues, the warning signals are getting louder. Bernie Sanders changed the debate in the US with his focus on economic inequality. Credit:AP  These accelerating trends in world affairs might seem distant from us, but they will be accompanied by the rapid intensification of political arguments that will affect us all - over inequality, debt and state power. Tens of millions of people across the developed world are losing their jobs or livelihoods, and they are predominantly those who are already less well off. It has been the natural tendency of the new technologies of recent decades to widen inequality, increasing the returns to capital rather than labour and leaving poorly educated people out of the booming global economy. Here comes the sharpest recession of our lives on top of that. It will push to the forefront of politics fundamental issues about the taxation of wealth, the case for basic incomes provided by governments, and the responsibility of companies for their employees. With young people the most severely affected socially and economically - the year they are losing can never be restored and the jobs they were hoping for will be in shorter supply - the issue of how to handle the vast debts now being accumulated will shoot to the top of election agendas. Political parties will campaign for debt forgiveness and write-offs, and for the cancelling by central banks of money borrowed by governments, with inflationary consequences. Tracking apps are being used in Asia to help find contacts of infected patients.  Credit:Bloomberg Most suddenly of all, the immense questions about who owns data about each of us, and what use the state can make of it, are coming in weeks instead of over many years. Once we are all carrying around an app on our phones to show where we have been and who we have met, pressure will grow to use that information for other purposes. Do we use it to stop a terrorist attack? To solve a murder? To detect a spy? If the answers are yes, what is the new boundary between the state and the individual? Most of these trends, speeding up as I write, are profoundly disturbing, but at least we can be better equipped for them if we can see them racing towards us. More optimistically, they have one positive companion - the massive incentive this crisis provides for innovation. New ideas about healthcare and communications have become dramatically more urgent, and some of them will change our lives more quickly and positively than would otherwise have happened. If any of the dire trends I have listed can be slowed down by this crisis being defused, that will happen because of new drugs now being trialled, new tests being invented and new healthcare devices being planned. But be in no doubt, as the long days at home seem to pass ever so slowly: in its effect on societies, politics and the distribution of power in the world, COVID-19 is on track to be the Great Accelerator.

The findings, based on 166 sets of data covering 1676 sites in 41 countries dating as far back as 1925, provided a nuanced assessment for insects, the most ubiquitous and diverse animals on the planet. An insect flies next to a flower in Erfurt, Germany.Credit:AP Insects such as mosquitoes - which live in the water as larvae - as well as midges, mayflies, water beetles and caddisflies that spend at least part of their lives in freshwater were found to have experienced a population increase of about 11 per cent per decade. Freshwater covers only about 2.5 per cent of the Earth's surface, so the vast majority of insects live on land. Other bugs are disappearing at a rate of just under 1 per cent a year, with lots of variation from place to place, according to the study published in the journal Science.

16,/world/north-america/bugged-earth-s-land-insects-are-disappearing-20200424-p54n1n.html,Bugged: Earth's land insects are disappearing,"Washington: The world's ants, bees, butterflies, grasshoppers, fireflies and other land-dwelling insects have been suffering population drops of about 9 per cent per decade but freshwater bugs such as dragonflies and mosquitoes have been rallying, researchers say in a new study. The findings, based on 166 sets of data covering 1676 sites in 41 countries dating as far back as 1925, provided a nuanced assessment for insects, the most ubiquitous and diverse animals on the planet.

Freshwater covers only about 2.5 per cent of the Earth's surface, so the vast majority of insects live on land. Other bugs are disappearing at a rate of just under 1 per cent a year, with lots of variation from place to place, according to the study published in the journal Science.

The occasion: a rally calling on the state's Republican Governor Larry Hogan to end his coronavirus stay-at-home order. Hundreds of vehicles clogged the city's streets, as drivers honked their horns to convey their anger at the lockdown. ""It was a very boisterous crowd,"" Duke says. ""We made our demands loud and clear."" The Baltimore lawyer says his legal firm has had to lay off some employees. But unlike the 26 million Americans who have filed for unemployment over the past five weeks, he still has a job and is going to work. His opposition to the shutdown is driven more by philosophy than personal circumstance. ""Our civil liberties - our freedom of assembly, our freedom of speech, our property rights are being trampled on,"" says Duke, who describes himself as a conservative Republican. ""The government is picking winners and losers by allowing certain businesses to remain open while others shut down."" Instead of draconian regulations, he says governments should trust individual citizens to do the right thing - even if it risks an increase in COVID-19 cases. ""A resurgence is possible, I'm sure,"" he says. One nation, two realities The Annapolis protest was just one of dozens of anti-shutdown events that have broken out in recent weeks across the US. The demonstrations have had a distinctly conservative flavour, with many attendees waving Trump 2020 flags and wearing red ""Make America Great Again"" hats. Some of the protests signs have included: ""Social distancing = communism"" and ""Give me liberty or give me death"". Gun rights advocates have organised several protests and free market groups have helped to promote them. Hundreds of protesters gather outside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz' official residence, Credit:Star Tribune The protesters do not speak for a majority of the country: just 12 per cent of Americans believe the restrictions they are living under have gone too far, according to an Associated Press poll released this week. But they do reflect a fundamental divide in how Americans of different political persuasions - and different media habits - are responding the pandemic. ""Because of the deep polarisation in the US, partisanship has become the wide-angle lens through which everything is distorted,"" says Morgan Marietta, the author of One Nation, Two Realities: Dueling Facts in American Democracy. ""The connections between partisanship and the pandemic are remarkably tight."" According to a Morning Consult poll released this week, Republicans were five times as likely as Democrats to say that Americans should stop social distancing to stimulate the economy - even if it means increasing the spread of coronavirus. The difference is similarly stark when you look at which media outlets Americans rely on for information. A poll by The Wall Street Journal and NBC this week found that 45 per cent of Fox News viewers were worried the government would re-open the country too slowly - twice as many as those who get their news from more left-leaning cable networks MSNBC or CNN. Deeply obsessed with Fox  When Donald Trump sent out a series of all-caps tweets on Friday, April 17 - ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"", ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA!"" - they seemed to come out of nowhere. But not to Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at the progressive watchdog organisation Media Matters. Gertz's focus is untangling the feedback loop between Trump and Fox News - specifically the relationship between Trump's tweets and Fox programming. Last year Gertz identified 657 Trump tweets in which he was reacting to segments aired on Fox. ""Trump is deeply obsessed with Fox News - he watches it constantly, he responds to it in real time,"" Gertz says. ""It gives the network a huge amount of influence over US and global affairs."" Trump's ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA"" tweet - widely interpreted as a message of encouragement to anti-lockdown protesters - came just two minutes after Fox aired footage of protests organised by a group called Liberate Minnesota. ""He was very obviously watching the network and taking his cues from it, which led him to promote quite a dangerous movement against social distancing,"" Gertz says. Images of anti-lockdown protests have appeared across all media networks. But the coverage on Fox has been far more extensive and positive, reminding many of the station's crucial role popularising the Tea Party movement in the early days of Barack Obama's presidency. ""They are promoting future protests, telling people when and where they are happening,"" Gertz says. ""They are ginning up support for what is really a small and unpopular movement."" Hosts on left-leaning MSNBC, meanwhile, have responded to the protests with alarm, and have tended to be relentlessly critical of Trump's handling of the pandemic. The difference an hour makes  While Fox's coverage has been overwhelmingly friendly to Trump, it has not been monolithic. In the early days of the pandemic, there were noticeable differences in approach between Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, whose shows air each weeknight at 8pm and 9pm respectively. It's a difference researchers believe cost lives. Replay   Both Hannity and Carlson are big supporters of Trump. But while Hannity initially downplayed the threat of the virus, Carlson portrayed it as a major threat. He even travelled to Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago resort in early March to urge the President to take the virus more seriously. Carlson's stance was influenced by his hawkish views on China, where the virus is believed to have originated. On February 25, Carlson warned his viewers about the deadly risks of the virus, saying that it could kill up to a million people in the US. Two days later, Hannity was favourably comparing the virus to the common flu and car crashes. ""Carlson continued to discuss the subject extensively throughout February while Hannity did not mention it again on his show until the end of the month,"" economists from the University of Chicago and Harvard wrote in a working paper published this week titled Misinformation During a Pandemic. They examined whether viewing one show rather than the other led to different behaviours and health outcomes. Their finding: yes, it did. The economists found Hannity fans began changing their behaviours to minimise the risk of contracting the virus five days later than viewers of other Fox shows. Carlson fans changed their behaviours three days earlier, a difference that had significant consequences. ""Greater exposure to Hannity relative to Tucker Carlson Tonight leads to a greater number of COVID-19 cases and deaths,"" they wrote. ""A one-standard deviation increase in relative viewership of Hannity relative to Carlson is associated with approximately 30 per cent more COVID-19 cases on March 14, and 21 per cent more COVID-19 deaths on March 28."" They concluded: ""Our findings indicate that provision of misinformation in the early stages of a pandemic can have important consequences for health outcomes."" A very special thing Viewers of Trump's daily White House briefings have seen him repeatedly hype up hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, as a potential coronavirus cure. ""It'll be wonderful, it'll be so beautiful, it'll be a gift from heaven if it works,"" Trump said earlier this month, even as his top health advisers cautioned that its benefits were unproven. Trump's enthusiasm was strongly influenced by Fox News - in particular host Laura Ingraham, whose show follows Hannity's each weeknight. According to Media Matters, Ingraham made 84 promotional mentions of the drug between March 23 and April 6 - more than any other presenter on the network. At the start of April, Ingraham reportedly met privately with Trump at the White House to sell him on the potential benefits of the drug. Two days later, at his daily briefing, Trump called the drug a ""very special thing"" and said a lot of people were recommending people take it. ""What do you have to lose?"" he said on April 4. This week a study of hundreds of US veterans found that those who used hydroxychloroquine were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation and had higher deaths rates compared to those who did not take it. It followed studies from France and Brazil that found no statistical benefits from taking the drug and dangerous side effects for many patients, including heart rhythm problems. Populism and pandemics Political scientist Morgan Marietta says the divergent coverage on networks like Fox and MSNBC reinforces and amplifies the partitioning of American society. Dramatic government intervention into societal and economic life is especially confronting to conservatives like Hunter Duke, who attended the Reopen Maryland protest. ""Individualists want to see individual decisions as effective and a large government role as unnecessary,"" Marietta says. ""Resistance to the government response of shutting down the economy fits with their previous support for free enterprise and distrust of government."" Equally important, he says, is the newer populism that defines Trump's presidency. ""Populism argues that the common person is being exploited by the snobbish but undeserving elites in academia, media, and government,"" he says. ""The populists of the new Republican Party have very little faith that the alleged experts have a true sense of what is going on and what should be done."" Partisan responses to the pandemic may have broken down had the virus affected Democrats and Republicans equally. But it hasn't. Coronavirus death rates have been highest in densely-populated and racially-diverse cities like New York and Chicago where Democrats dominate. Meanwhile, rural white voters who tend to support Trump have emerged relatively unscathed from the virus - even as their local economies have been essentially shut down.

21,/world/north-america/coronavirus-struggles-to-survive-in-sunlight-heat-white-house-20200424-p54mtg.html,"Coronavirus struggles to survive in sunlight, heat: White House","Washington: Sunlight, heat and humidity are highly effective at stopping the spread of the coronavirus, according to new scientific findings released by the White House. The findings were based on preliminary tests conducted in the US Department of Homeland Security's bio-defence laboratories. US President Donald Trump encouraged Americans to go outside into the sun. Credit:AP ""Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect solar light appears to have on killing the virus on both surfaces and in the air,"" said Bill Bryan, the head of the science and technology directorate at the Department. Bryan said the department had found a ""similar effect with both temperature and humidity"". He said the research suggested that people should spend time in the sun and that air conditioning temperatures may need to be increased. He stressed that this did not mean that people should abandon physical distancing or stop practising personal hygiene as temperatures rise. ""This is just a tool in our tool box,"" Bryan said. Reporters at the briefing immediately questioned the implications of the research given New Orleans, which has a warm and humid climate year round, has experienced one of the worst US outbreaks. There have also been significant outbreaks in countries such as Singapore, despite its hot and muggy climate. US President Donald Trump leapt upon the results to claim justification for statements earlier this year in which he said he believed the virus would go away as temperatures increased in April. ""I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden,"" Trump said. ""I hope people enjoy the sun and if it has an impact, that's great."" In February Trump said: ""Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away."" Replay   The briefing featured a series of bemusing encounters as Trump asked medical advisers whether ultra-violet rays could be applied to the human body, or some form of internal disinfectant used, to cure the disease. ""Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning?"" Trump asked Bryan from Homeland Security. He then asked Dr Deborah Birx, the physician co-ordinating the White House's coronavirus taskforce: ""I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way you can apply light and heat to cure. You know? If you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can't."" Birx said she had not seen any evidence that heat or UV rays could be used as a treatment for the virus. Health experts immediately warned that sunlight was not a ""miracle cure"" for COVID-19 and that people should not try to treat it by tanning - especially given the risks of developing skin cancer. On Friday, China announced it donated a further $US30 million ($47 million) to the World Health Organisation following Trump's decision to halt funding, amid concerns the UN agency is too ""China-centric"". Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the extra funds would help the WHO contain the virus and support developing countries in improving their public health systems.

22,/world/north-america/coronavirus-struggles-to-survive-in-sunlight-heat-white-house-20200424-p54mtg.html,"Coronavirus struggles to survive in sunlight, heat: White House","Washington: Sunlight, heat and humidity are highly effective at stopping the spread of the coronavirus, according to new scientific findings released by the White House. The findings were based on preliminary tests conducted in the US Department of Homeland Security's bio-defence laboratories. US President Donald Trump encouraged Americans to go outside into the sun. Credit:AP ""Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect solar light appears to have on killing the virus on both surfaces and in the air,"" said Bill Bryan, the head of the science and technology directorate at the Department. Bryan said the department had found a ""similar effect with both temperature and humidity"". He said the research suggested that people should spend time in the sun and that air conditioning temperatures may need to be increased. He stressed that this did not mean that people should abandon physical distancing or stop practising personal hygiene as temperatures rise. ""This is just a tool in our tool box,"" Bryan said. Reporters at the briefing immediately questioned the implications of the research given New Orleans, which has a warm and humid climate year round, has experienced one of the worst US outbreaks. There have also been significant outbreaks in countries such as Singapore, despite its hot and muggy climate. US President Donald Trump leapt upon the results to claim justification for statements earlier this year in which he said he believed the virus would go away as temperatures increased in April. ""I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden,"" Trump said. ""I hope people enjoy the sun and if it has an impact, that's great."" In February Trump said: ""Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away."" Replay   The briefing featured a series of bemusing encounters as Trump asked medical advisers whether ultra-violet rays could be applied to the human body, or some form of internal disinfectant used, to cure the disease. ""Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning?"" Trump asked Bryan from Homeland Security. He then asked Dr Deborah Birx, the physician co-ordinating the White House's coronavirus taskforce: ""I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way you can apply light and heat to cure. You know? If you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can't."" Birx said she had not seen any evidence that heat or UV rays could be used as a treatment for the virus. Health experts immediately warned that sunlight was not a ""miracle cure"" for COVID-19 and that people should not try to treat it by tanning - especially given the risks of developing skin cancer. On Friday, China announced it donated a further $US30 million ($47 million) to the World Health Organisation following Trump's decision to halt funding, amid concerns the UN agency is too ""China-centric"". Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the extra funds would help the WHO contain the virus and support developing countries in improving their public health systems.

Some analysts foresee a litigious phase as victims' families rally in anger in Facebook groups and prosecutors weigh manslaughter charges over deaths at some nursing homes. The country's coronavirus epidemic was among the world's deadliest, with an official toll of more than 25,000.

""The pandemic is going to turn into a big collective trial."" Prosecutors have begun investigating whether errors by authorities had contributed to or caused the deadliest clusters. Liberal members of Parliament have accused the conservative government in the Lombardy region, where the country's first infections appeared, of exacerbating the contagion. About 45,000 relatives of coronavirus victims have joined ""NOI Denunceremo"" (""We will denounce you""), a Facebook group for people who believe that not enough was done to save their relatives. Lawyers have begun advertising their services to mourning families in response to allegations of mistakes committed by healthcare workers in treating coronavirus patients.

She added that, at this point, she would not know whom to sue. Diego Federici, 35, said that his mother had the coronavirus and died on March 25 after doctors in a hospital in Treviglio, near Milan, decided not to intubate her. His father, who was never admitted to an intensive care unit, had died four days earlier. Federici said he had joined the NOI Denunceremo Facebook group, adding that he could not accept that two healthy people had died within four days. ""Nobody is going to give me my parents back,"" he said, ""but if someone did something wrong, they should pay for it."" Luca Fusco, the founder of the Facebook group, initially posted his email address for members to send their stories anonymously, but dozens of members soon started directly publishing their testimonies every day. The authors do not directly accuse healthcare workers of malfeasance. As the painful stories of the epidemic piled up on Facebook, judiciary authorities began searching for someone to blame. Prosecutors started an investigation into what they call an ""involuntary epidemic"" at a hospital in Alzano, near Bergamo, where the virus spread through the medical wards. Maria Cristina Rota, Bergamo's prosecutor, told the news agency Ansa that a pool of prosecutors would ""take care of all the investigations about the epidemic in the Bergamo area."" They are also considering manslaughter charges against directors of retirement homes where hundreds of residents died and where the full death toll may have been hidden. Italians are not the only ones seeking some form of accountability for the pandemic. In the United States, the state of Missouri filed a lawsuit against the Chinese government on Wednesday (AEST), saying its response to the outbreak that emerged in the city of Wuhan had led to devastating economic losses in the state. A ski resort hotel in the Dolomites also presented a subpoena in an Italian court seeking compensation from China's Health Ministry for loss of business after the outbreak, Marco Vignola, the lawyer for the hotel, told news outlets. ""The early and sudden closure led to disastrous consequences, including the dismissal of all staff and the cancellation of contracts with suppliers,"" the lawyer was quoted as saying. On April 15, legislators from the governing Democratic Party blamed Lombardy's conservative government for the high number of deaths in the region's retirement homes.

Johnson has spent the past week increasing his workload in readiness for his return to Westminster. He is now speaking to Dominic Raab, his stand-in, on an almost daily basis, holds daily meetings with his political team, demands government papers and has also been following parliamentary proceedings - including Sir Keir Starmer's first appearance as leader of the opposition during Prime Minister's Questions - as well as speaking to US President Donald Trump to discuss the coronavirus and a UK-US trade deal. One source said: ""He's not the sort of person who is very good at doing nothing. In truth, he has been working pretty much full time for the past week.

Ministers have been told to be ready for Johnson to be back at work on Monday, though Downing Street insisted no final decision had been made and he would take into account his medical advice. He is expected to chair a Cabinet meeting next week, and senior Tories hope Johnson will give the country the clarity that has been lacking on the exit strategy. Raab, Priti Patel, Liz Truss, Robert Jenrick and Rishi Sunak are understood to be among the strongest advocates for getting the economy going again. Johnson will return at a critical time, with the country more than a month into lockdown, and ministers are relying on him to inject fresh impetus into plans for an exit strategy. Senior Cabinet ministers are concerned that a prolonged shutdown will lead to tens of thousands of companies collapsing and inflict irreparable damage to the economy. There are clear signs that businesses and the public are growing tired of the lockdown, with increasing numbers of firms reopening and car use on the rise. The pressure to set out the route out of lockdown grew on Thursday as Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, revealed Scotland's plans for dealing with the virus, having said politicians should treat the public like grown-ups.

Marguerite Mouille, 94, waves goodbye to her daughter at the Kaisesberg nursing home, eastern France.Credit:AP The assessment suggests public health authorities may have allowed the pandemic to rage among some of their most vulnerable populations as they focused on hospitals and other aspects of their response. A ""deeply concerning picture"" is emerging about residents of homes for the elderly, Hans Kluge, the WHO's top official for Europe, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. According to countries' estimates, he said, ""up to half of those who have died from COVID-19 were resident in long-term care facilities. This is an unimaginable human tragedy."" Kluge's warning focused on Europe, but the United States has also struggled with the pandemic at homes for the elderly. A Washington Post analysis this week found that nearly 1 in 10 nursing homes in the United States have reported cases of the coronavirus, with a death count that has reached the thousands. Many countries in Europe have banned family visits to nursing homes, an attempt to shelter the facilities from the spread of the disease, since it is far more fatal among older people and those with pre-existing conditions.

""This pandemic has shown a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued corners of our society,"" Kluge said. He and other WHO officials who spoke on Thursday said they did not have enough data to say conclusively that people in nursing homes were being transferred to hospitals less often than they should be, or that they were being discharged from hospitals prematurely - fears raised by advocates in Britain and elsewhere. But the WHO officials hinted strongly that those factors might be contributing to the high death rates. Replay   ""It is important that the decisions, the very tough decisions that have to be made, are not based on a single criteria like age,"" said Manfred Huber, a WHO long-term care specialist. Measuring and comparing coronavirus death rates can be difficult, since some nations are testing more suspected coronavirus cases than others are and each country is using different accounting methods as they record cases and deaths. Many countries in Europe have essentially ignored testing in nursing homes to focus their capacity on hospital patients and hospital staffers. In Italy, for instance, a recent national health service report indicated that people dying in nursing homes were overwhelmingly unlikely to have been tested for the virus. And many countries have not been carefully tracking deaths outside of hospitals. ""The challenge is we don't have very good information for people in care homes,"" said Adelina Comas-Herrera, a researcher at the London School of Economics. Comas-Herrera and colleagues reported last week that coronavirus deaths in nursing facilities in Belgium, Canada, France, Ireland and Norway might account for half of those countries' deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. She noted that most elderly care homes were never designed to serve as acute care hospitals. Many do not even have a nurse on duty.

Spain's defence minister pledged that the government would be ""unrelenting and forceful"" in finding those responsible. As of this week, public prosecutors are investigating some 86 nursing homes throughout Spain for hundreds of elderly deaths, including 40 facilities in the region of Madrid, which has outpaced the rest of the country in death toll. Spain has not included deaths in nursing homes in its official counts, although authorities say 10 per cent to 20 per cent of residents might be infected. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Wednesday told Parliament that nursing home residents might represent 20 per cent of all deaths in that country. That corresponds to an estimate by the non-profit National Care Forum, which says elderly and disabled people in residential and nursing homes account for 4000 of Britain's nearly 19,000 coronavirus-related deaths. But some researchers in Britain have put the number as high as 40 per cent for deaths in care homes - a staggering number, considering that such facilities house less than 1 per cent of the country's population. In Belgium, where officials have included suspected cases in their overall death count since early this month, more than half of the 6450 recorded deaths were in long-term care facilities, not hospitals. And of those nursing-home deaths, 95 per cent were ""suspected"" cases, meaning that patients displayed some symptoms of COVID-19 but were never tested for the disease. ""We have not had enough testing capacity in the past to confirm all of them in the laboratory,"" said Steven van Gucht, the head of viral diseases at Belgium's public health institute, at a news conference this week. ""But that does not mean that those cases are less real."" Kluge and others say now is the time to pour resources into nursing homes - to provide more testing of staff and residents, to supply caregivers with proper protective gowns and visors, to give them quick training to protect themselves and residents. Some employees have complained that they have been offered little or no equipment. Many facilities are staffed by people with scant medical training or none at all. Despite the vulnerability of most residents of the facilities, Kluge said, good medical care ought to be able to prevent many deaths. ""Even among very old people who are frail and live with multiple chronic conditions, many have a good chance of recovery if they are well-cared for,"" he said. Italian authorities have said some of the worst outbreaks at nursing homes might have been preventable, and they have launched investigations into malpractice at a series of facilities, including one of the largest in the country: the 1000-bed Pio Albergo Trivulzio in Milan. Italy's ANSA news service reported that 200 elderly residents had died at that facility. In France, one of the earliest coronavirus restrictions was an urging by President Emmanuel Macron that people stop visiting elderly relatives in assisted-living centres. But as the French government began to give daily briefings on the rising death toll and number of confirmed infections, figures from assisted-living centres and care homes were initially excluded from the tally, and only included starting April 1. The numbers are still reported irregularly, largely because it takes public health authorities longer to collate data from centres spread across the country. The plight of the elderly isolated in homes away from their families has gained increasing traction in France. Jeanne Pault, 96, lamented in a televised interview this week that she hasn't been able to eat properly, and that she was no longer able to converse with her neighbour, much less her family. ""Is this a life, at age 96?"" Pault said. Macron responded to her directly on Twitter. ""Madame, your grief overwhelms us all,"" he wrote. ""For you, for all our seniors in retirement homes or institutions, visits from loved ones are now authorised.""

A ""deeply concerning picture"" is emerging about residents of homes for the elderly, Hans Kluge, the WHO's top official for Europe, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. According to countries' estimates, he said, ""up to half of those who have died from COVID-19 were resident in long-term care facilities. This is an unimaginable human tragedy."" Kluge's warning focused on Europe, but the United States has also struggled with the pandemic at homes for the elderly. A Washington Post analysis this week found that nearly 1 in 10 nursing homes in the United States have reported cases of the coronavirus, with a death count that has reached the thousands.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signs a guestbook next to his sister Kim Yo Jong, right, inside the Peace House at the border village of Panmunjom in Demilitarized Zone in 2018.Credit:AP North Korea's state media channel, the Korean Central News Agency, published the text of reply that Kim allegedly sent on Wednesday. ""Kim Jong-un, in his message, expressed his deep thanks to the president of the Syrian Arab Republic for sending his heartfelt message of greeting, reflecting the warm respect for president Kim Il-sung, who is always alive in the hearts of the Korean people and the world progressives, on the occasion of his 108th birth anniversary,"" the state agency reported in an English-language article. But the report did not address the questions raised on Tuesday about Kim's health - which flared after he skipped an April 15 commemoration of his grandfather's birthday. It's North Korea's most important event, and Kim, 36, hadn't missed it since inheriting power from his father in late 2011. Kim has been out of the public eye for extended periods in the past, and the regime's secretive nature allows few outsiders to assert confidently whether he might be unwell, let alone incapacitated. Still, questions about the North's political future are likely to grow if he fails to attend upcoming public events. Kim is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea, and a strong personality cult has been built around him, his father and grandfather. The family's mythical Paektu bloodline, named after the highest peak on the Korean Peninsula, Mount Paektu, is said to give only direct family members the right to rule the nation. That makes Kim's younger sister, senior ruling party official Kim Yo-jong, the most likely candidate to step in if her brother is gravely ill, incapacitated or dies. But some experts say a collective leadership, which could end the family's dynastic rule, could also be possible. ""Among the North's power elite, Kim Yo-jong has the highest chance to inherit power, and I think that possibility is more than 90 per cent,"" said analyst Cheong Seong-chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea. ""North Korea is like a dynasty, and we can view the Paektu descent as royal blood so it's unlikely for anyone to raise any issue over Kim Yo-jong taking power."" Believed to be in her early 30s, Kim Yo-jong is in charge of North Korea's propaganda affairs, and earlier this month was made an alternate member of the powerful Politburo. She has frequently appeared with her brother at public activities, standing out among elderly male officials. She accompanied Kim Jong-un on his high-stakes summits with US President Donald Trump and other world leaders in recent years. Her proximity to him during those summits led many outsiders to believe she's essentially North Korea's No. 2 official. Replay   ""I think the basic assumption would be that maybe it would be someone in the family"" to replace Kim Jong-un, US national security adviser Robert O'Brien told reporters on Tuesday. ""But again, it's too early to talk about that because we just don't know, you know, what condition Chairman Kim is in and we'll have to see how it plays out."" The fact that North Korea is an extremely patriarchal society has led some to wonder if Kim Yo-jong would only serve as a temporary figurehead and then be replaced by a collective leadership similar to ones established after the deaths of other Communist dictators. ""North Korean politics and the three hereditary power transfers have been male-centred. I wonder whether she can really overcome bloody socialist power struggles and exercise her power,"" said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University in South Korea. A collective leadership would likely be headed by Choe Ryong-hae, North Korea's ceremonial head of state who officially ranks No. 2 in the country's current power hierarchy, Nam said.

Health workers collects samples for coronavirus testing outside a shack to combat the spread of COVID-19 at Lenasia South, Johannesburg, South Africa.Credit:AP Africa also has a ""very, very limited"" and ""very, very strained"" testing capacity, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said in his weekly briefing on Thursday. The surge in infections on the continent is almost certainly under-reported and even higher in reality, say medical experts. WHO's recent report painted a grim picture for Africa, one of the last continents to be hit by the pandemic. WHO warned the virus could kill more than 300,000 people and push 30 million into desperate poverty. Africa still has time to avert such a disaster, Nkengasong said, but testing people and tracing virus cases is critical. South African National Defence Forces patrol in Johannesburg as residents  protest against the lack of food. Many have lost their income after a strict five-week lockdown in an effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Credit:AP ""It all depends on what we are discussing here, which is, are you testing? Are you finding the cases? Are you isolating and tracking the contacts?"" Nkengasong said, adding that the WHO report ""is not a prediction that means it must happen."" By Nkengasong's own criteria, Africa is struggling on the testing front. In the two months since the continent began mobilising to fight the outbreak, less than 500,000 tests have been conducted on the population of more than 1 billion. That's just 325 people tested per 1 million people, Nkengasong said. That's far lower than Italy, for example, one of the world's worst-hit countries, he said. ""If you don't test, you don't find. And if you don't test, you are blinded. If you don't test, you are not ahead of the curve,"" Nkengasong said. African governments reported a total of nearly 26,000 cases as of Thursday, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, up from just over 16,000 a week ago. Around 1200 people have died. Although those figures are still relatively small in the global picture, the sharp increase in cases is a cause for concern, said Nkengasong. The previous week saw an increase of 29 per cent. The Africa Centres for Disease Control has a target of conducting 1 million more tests over the next four weeks and 10 million tests in the next four months. The overall effort is badly hampered, Nkengasong said, by a major obstacle: the existing fragility of the health services. ""I'd like to make sure I make this very clear,"" he said. ""It is an uphill battle to build health systems while you need them. ... That is what we are actually doing now. We are playing catch-up and that is a very, very tough thing to do."" South Africa has nearly 4000 reported cases, according to its Health Ministry, the highest in the continent. It also saw a big one-day jump of 318 new cases on Thursday and 75 people have now died. But Africa's most developed economy is being praised for an aggressive testing program. South Africa, aided by existing infrastructure, has carried out more than 140,000 tests, according to its health minister. And ""they are starting to see a bending of their curve."" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa. Their early and tentative signs of success - helped, maybe, by a strict lockdown - are being set off by ""concerning increases"" in virus cases in some countries in West Africa and East Africa, Moeti said. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with 200 million people and a high population density, is a stark example of the testing and health system shortcomings prevalent across the continent.

Health workers collects samples for coronavirus testing outside a shack to combat the spread of COVID-19 at Lenasia South, Johannesburg, South Africa.Credit:AP Africa also has a ""very, very limited"" and ""very, very strained"" testing capacity, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said in his weekly briefing on Thursday. The surge in infections on the continent is almost certainly under-reported and even higher in reality, say medical experts. WHO's recent report painted a grim picture for Africa, one of the last continents to be hit by the pandemic. WHO warned the virus could kill more than 300,000 people and push 30 million into desperate poverty. Africa still has time to avert such a disaster, Nkengasong said, but testing people and tracing virus cases is critical. South African National Defence Forces patrol in Johannesburg as residents  protest against the lack of food. Many have lost their income after a strict five-week lockdown in an effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Credit:AP ""It all depends on what we are discussing here, which is, are you testing? Are you finding the cases? Are you isolating and tracking the contacts?"" Nkengasong said, adding that the WHO report ""is not a prediction that means it must happen."" By Nkengasong's own criteria, Africa is struggling on the testing front. In the two months since the continent began mobilising to fight the outbreak, less than 500,000 tests have been conducted on the population of more than 1 billion. That's just 325 people tested per 1 million people, Nkengasong said. That's far lower than Italy, for example, one of the world's worst-hit countries, he said. ""If you don't test, you don't find. And if you don't test, you are blinded. If you don't test, you are not ahead of the curve,"" Nkengasong said. African governments reported a total of nearly 26,000 cases as of Thursday, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, up from just over 16,000 a week ago. Around 1200 people have died. Although those figures are still relatively small in the global picture, the sharp increase in cases is a cause for concern, said Nkengasong. The previous week saw an increase of 29 per cent. The Africa Centres for Disease Control has a target of conducting 1 million more tests over the next four weeks and 10 million tests in the next four months. The overall effort is badly hampered, Nkengasong said, by a major obstacle: the existing fragility of the health services. ""I'd like to make sure I make this very clear,"" he said. ""It is an uphill battle to build health systems while you need them. ... That is what we are actually doing now. We are playing catch-up and that is a very, very tough thing to do."" South Africa has nearly 4000 reported cases, according to its Health Ministry, the highest in the continent. It also saw a big one-day jump of 318 new cases on Thursday and 75 people have now died. But Africa's most developed economy is being praised for an aggressive testing program. South Africa, aided by existing infrastructure, has carried out more than 140,000 tests, according to its health minister. And ""they are starting to see a bending of their curve."" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa. Their early and tentative signs of success - helped, maybe, by a strict lockdown - are being set off by ""concerning increases"" in virus cases in some countries in West Africa and East Africa, Moeti said. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with 200 million people and a high population density, is a stark example of the testing and health system shortcomings prevalent across the continent. The country has reported 873 cases of COVID-19 and 28 deaths but had conducted just 7153 tests as of Wednesday, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Around 5000 of those tests only came in the last week. ""The truth is, we have to work with what we have.

Unable to log on from the humble, dirt-floor home he shares with his parents and five other relatives, Contreras said he was frustrated because he knew the clock was ticking and thought he might have to drop a class or even miss the whole school year. ""I told myself I had to find a solution, and thank God I did. I saw the tree and I thought if I climb to the top the signal will probably reach me,"" the communications student said. Scaling the tree was enough to pick up a weak signal in the poor Atiquizaya municipality, about 84 kilometres west of capital San Salvador.

Last week, Bukele shared photos on social media of Contreras studying in the tree and ordered Innovation Secretary Vladimir Handal to contact the young man. ""Connect a device to get him a free and good broadband signal. Tell him I say congratulations,"" Bukele wrote in a Twitter post that has garnered over 56,000 likes.

49,/world/middle-east/oil-collapse-linked-to-coronavirus-topples-nations-political-plans-20200423-p54mj2.html,Coronavirus-triggered oil price collapse topples nations' political plans,"New York: Iraq cannot afford to pay millions of workers and pensioners. Mexico's grand plans to develop the country have been thrown into disarray. Ecuador is cutting government salaries, and Venezuela is on life support. Nigeria is seeking a nearly $US7 billion ($11 billion) emergency loan. Oil prices have collapsed amid plunging demand linked to coronavirus.Credit:AP The coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in oil prices it has caused have created a monstrous calamity for countries heavily reliant on oil production for their economic survival and forced others to change policies that no longer make economic sense. While Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States — the biggest oil producers — have large financial cushions, the precipitous drop in demand because billions of people have been forced to stay home has upended everything. It was a possibility even veteran industry experts did not foresee. ""No one imagined a crisis of this scope. This was in no scenario,"" said Daniel Yergin, an expert on global energy and vice chairman of IHS Markit, a research firm. Here is a look at some effects of the oil-coronavirus shock in countries around the world: Iraq will be harder hit than almost any other oil-dependent state, according to the International Energy Agency. About 90 per cent of the government's revenue comes from oil, and it relies on that money to support a payroll of more than 4 million workers as well as payments to pensions and welfare for the poor. The government could just meet its costs when oil was trading at about $US61 a barrel, as it was in December, but now it cannot meet the May payroll let alone pay for pensions, subsidies and its other operations. ""The problem starts in May,"" said Mudher Mohammed Saleh, an economist and adviser to Iraq's prime minister. ""We'll have a $US4.5 billion gap monthly. What do you do? This is the headache."" Oil has been critical to the Mexican government's plan for nation-building.Credit:Bloomberg Even before the pandemic and the plunge in oil prices, Mexico's economic outlook was poor, with some forecasters predicting its economy would remain sluggish after entering a mild recession in 2019. The federal budget relies heavily on oil production and exports, which means government income will be sharply diminished. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has laid out an ambitious development plan predicated on reviving Pemex, the state oil company, which has been suffering declining output, suffocating debt, corruption and mismanagement. But in recent weeks, raising money for Pemex in financial markets became much harder as major ratings agencies downgraded the company's credit. Daniel Lansberg-Rodríguez, the Latin America director at Greenmantle, a risk advisory firm, said that López Obrador has long viewed Pemex as ""the silver bullet"" that will rescue the economy. ""Come hell or high water, the strategy won't change,"" he said. The oil market rout has reverberated across South America but will be felt the most by the region's weakest economy Venezuela, which relies on its shrinking crude sales to import food and fuel. Even before the price collapse, the country struggled to find buyers because of tightening U.S. sanctions. The International Monetary Fund forecasts Venezuela's economy will shrink 15 per cent this year, the biggest decline in the region. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.Credit:AP In oil-dependent Ecuador, President Lenin Moreno has called the energy market collapse the country's ""most critical moment in its history."" As in Venezuela, the price collapse has caught Ecuador in one of the worst economic moments as the country struggles to contain Latin America's most aggressive outbreak of coronavirus and deal with a rupture of its two main oil pipelines. Even before the price collapse, the World Bank predicted that the pandemic would push sub-Saharan Africa into its first recession in 25 years. But in the region's leading oil-producing nations, Nigeria and Angola, the compounding effect of drastically reduced income could be devastating. Both derive 90 per cent of export earnings and more than two-thirds of government revenue from oil sales. For decades Nigeria, which has requested $US6.9 billion in emergency funding from international lenders, spent billions of dollars to keep the price of gasoline in the country artificially low. This policy was scrapped in early April. Successive Nigerian governments have pledged but failed to end the country's reliance on oil. Four years ago this week, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia said that by this year, the kingdom would be able to survive without oil. That prediction was woefully optimistic. Replay   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude oil exporter, is as dependent on oil as ever. During his rise to become Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed began a range of initiatives, from diversifying the economy by expanding tourism and entertainment, to vanquishing foes in Yemen, to confronting Iran and other enemies. Now, the price crash has jeopardised the finances needed for those projects — meaning that instead of investing in a new solar-powered city on the Red Sea, the immediate focus will be balancing the kingdom's budget. The Saudi government was struggling to do so before the kingdom started an oil-price war with Russia last month, which only compounded the price drop caused by the pandemic. To balance its budget, the kingdom needs $US80 a barrel oil, four times the current price. Steffen Hertog, a professor of comparative politics at the London School of Economics, said the kingdom has about $US500 billion in foreign currency reserves, which could help cover a budget shortfall for about two years. But he said that if the Saudis have to tap those assets, ""the kitty is going to be much smaller."" In recent weeks, the kingdom has tried, unsuccessfully, to reach a cease-fire in Yemen, where it has spent tens of billions of dollars since 2015 trying to defeat the Houthis, a rebel group aligned with Iran. ""The war in Yemen has been expensive and that has been one motivation for ramping it down now,"" Hertog said. Russia has in many ways shrugged off the price tumble. Despite the drama on oil markets, the national currency, the rouble, dropped just 2 per cent on Tuesday. The historically high oil prices of the past two decades had lifted the country economically and powered President Vladimir Putin's ambitions. But Russia entered the crisis well prepared, with hard currency reserves and a tight budget put in place as protection against the Western sanctions of the past six years. Putin and his economic policy team can tap gold and hard currency reserves that total $US565 billion. How long Russia can hold out, however, is unclear. Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank, has estimated Russian reserves can support current spending at oil prices of $US35 per barrel for six years. Signs have emerged that Putin is nervous. Cushioning the price collapse is not the only demand on Russia's reserves: The country has not announced major bailouts for businesses harmed by coronavirus lockdowns, but they are likely. This month, Putin negotiated oil production cuts with other producers after walking away from talks with Saudi Arabia weeks ago. Low energy prices also have defanged Russia's oil and gas policies in Europe, which were partly intended to sow political divisions by giving favourable terms to Germany, Italy, Hungary and others. Now Russia has no leverage. Still, Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said he did not foresee a significant weakening of Russia despite the price collapse. ""All boats will sink because of low oil and the coronavirus crisis,"" said Kupchan. ""Russia's won't sink more than others and may not sink as much.""

This satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows activity at the Imam Khomeini Space Centre in Iran's Semnan province in February. Credit:AP On its official website, the Guard said the satellite successfully reached orbit at 425 kilometres above the Earth's surface. It called it the first military satellite ever launched by Tehran. The two-stage launch took off from the Central Desert, the Guard said, without elaborating or saying when exactly. The paramilitary force said it used a Ghased, or ""messenger"" satellite carrier to put the device into space, a previously unheard-of system. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the launch of the satellite, which the Guard called Noor, or light. The US State and Defence departments, which contend that such launches advance Iran's ballistic missile program, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news comes amid tensions between Tehran and Washington over its collapsing nuclear deal and after a US drone strike in Iraq killed Guard General Qassem Soleimani in January. Iran has suffered several failed satellite launches in recent months. The latest came in February, when it failed to put its Zafar 1 communications satellite into orbit. That came after two failed launches of the Payam and Doosti satellites last year, as well as a launchpad rocket explosion in August. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Centre in February 2019 also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time. The rocket explosion in August drew even the attention of US President Donald Trump, who later tweeted what appeared to be a classified surveillance image of the launch failure. The successive failures raised suspicion of outside interference in Iran's program, something Trump himself hinted at by tweeting at the time that the US ""was not involved in the catastrophic accident"". The US alleges such satellite launches defy a UN Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. American officials, as well as European nations, worry that these launches could help Iran develop intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. An Iranian rocket failed to put a satellite into orbit in February, but now the Revolutionary Guard says it has succeeded. Credit:AP Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, previously maintained its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. The Guard launching its own satellite now calls that into question. Tehran also says it hasn't violated a US resolution on its ballistic missile program as it only ""called upon"" Iran not to conduct such tests. Western missile experts have also questioned the US contention that Iran's program could have a dual use for nuclear weapons. Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space. The launch comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in May 2018. Iran since has broken all the deal's limitations while still allowing US inspectors to its sites. On Sunday, the Guard acknowledged it had a tense encounter with US warships in the Persian Gulf last week, but alleged without offering evidence that American forces sparked the incident.

That came after two failed launches of the Payam and Doosti satellites last year, as well as a launchpad rocket explosion in August. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Centre in February 2019 also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time. The rocket explosion in August drew even the attention of US President Donald Trump, who later tweeted what appeared to be a classified surveillance image of the launch failure. The successive failures raised suspicion of outside interference in Iran's program, something Trump himself hinted at by tweeting at the time that the US ""was not involved in the catastrophic accident"". The US alleges such satellite launches defy a UN Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. American officials, as well as European nations, worry that these launches could help Iran develop intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. An Iranian rocket failed to put a satellite into orbit in February, but now the Revolutionary Guard says it has succeeded. Credit:AP Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, previously maintained its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. The Guard launching its own satellite now calls that into question. Tehran also says it hasn't violated a US resolution on its ballistic missile program as it only ""called upon"" Iran not to conduct such tests. Western missile experts have also questioned the US contention that Iran's program could have a dual use for nuclear weapons. Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space. The launch comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in May 2018. Iran since has broken all the deal's limitations while still allowing US inspectors to its sites. On Sunday, the Guard acknowledged it had a tense encounter with US warships in the Persian Gulf last week, but alleged without offering evidence that American forces sparked the incident.

The deal averts what would have been a fourth consecutive election in just over a year as the country fights its coronavirus outbreak. Pedestrians pass an election campaign billboard with photos of Benny Gantz, left, and Benjamin Netanyahu in Ramat Gan, Israel.Credit:AP Netanyahu and former military chief Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, signed the power-sharing agreement after weeks of negotiations for what they termed a ""national emergency"" government meant to steer the country through the coronavirus outbreak. Although Netanyahu repeatedly came up short in three elections over the past year, the coalition agreement returns the long-serving leader as prime minister, defying critics who predicted his downfall and restoring his reputation as a political wizard. It means that Netanyahu will almost certainly remain in office for the duration of his upcoming trial on corruption charges. The deal calls for a three-year period, with Netanyahu serving as prime minister for the first half, and Gantz taking the job for the second half. Gantz's party will take control of a number of senior government ministries, including defence. The agreement delivers Netanyahu a significant boost as he fights to hold on to power while fending off corruption charges. His party will gain influence over judicial appointments. The deal also requires the approval of both parties on key appointments including the attorney-general and the state prosecutor - granting Netanyahu veto power over the officials who hold sway over his legal fate. ""I promised the state of Israel a national emergency government that will work to save the lives and livelihoods of the citizens of Israel,"" Netanyahu tweeted. After March 2 elections left both men short of a required parliamentary majority, Netanyahu and Gantz agreed to try to form a unity government because of the burgeoning coronavirus crisis. The talks stalled several times, reportedly over Netanyahu's personal legal problems, sparking concern that they would plunge the country into new elections. The deal required major compromise by both men. During three bitter campaigns over the past year, Gantz and his party vowed never to serve in a government under Netanyahu so long as he faced a slew of corruption charges. After 11 years as prime minister, Netanyahu agreed to step aside and allow Gantz to take the job, if the coalition managed to survive long enough. ""We prevented a fourth election,"" Gantz tweeted. ""We will protect democracy. We will battle corona and we will worry about all the citizens of Israel."" While the government was ostensibly formed to deal with the pandemic, which has killed more than 170 Israelis and ravaged the economy, negotiations revolved largely around Netanyahu's trial, set to start next month. Political analyst Avraham Diskin, who was involved in crafting part of the coalition deal, said guarantees by both sides were critical. Netanyahu wanted a guarantee he would not be forced to resign after Gantz takes over as prime minister. Israeli law requires all public officials, except for the prime minister, to step down if charged with a crime. Replay   For Blue and White, that meant assurances that Netanyahu wouldn't topple the government before Gantz becomes leader, Diskin said. ""There was a total lack of trust,"" he said. ""I pray that the government will hold up and won't miss the opportunity with fights over nonsense."" In a joint statement, the parties said they would form a six-month ""emergency"" government focused on the coronavirus crisis. In the meantime, they will work on a ""policy outline"" for a long-term unity government. The deal could clear the way for Netanyahu's campaign promise to annex large parts of the West Bank after July 1. Gantz has raised concerns about the plan, which is bitterly opposed by the Palestinians and much of the international community, saying it could only take place with broad international support. Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said the new government would have two options: ""to either open the doors for a meaningful peace process or to further jeaopardise any hope for peace."" Last month's election, just like the campaigns last September and April, ended with no clear winner. But with a slight majority of MPs endorsing him, Gantz was chosen first by the country's figurehead President to try to build a coalition government. The glue holding together Gantz's different backers was their shared animosity toward Netanyahu. Gantz began to move forward with legislation that would have disqualified the indicted Netanyahu from serving as prime minister in the future. But with the virus crisis worsening, and his own shaky alliance fraying, Gantz made an about-face late last month and accepted an offer from Netanyahu to pursue a joint government to deal with the pandemic. The move drew heavy criticism from Gantz's supporters and tore apart his Blue and White alliance. Negotiations continued even after Gantz' allotted time to build a coalition ended last week. The Knesset, or parliament, had been given until May 7 to select a candidate for prime minister. Otherwise, it would automatically have been dissolved and triggered new elections. On Sunday night, several thousand demonstrators, including Gantz's former political partner Yair Lapid, gathered in Tel Aviv to protest the emerging deal. Protesters accused Netanyahu of using the coronavirus crisis to shield himself from prosecution and accused Gantz of abandoning his central campaign promises. ""You don't fight corruption from within. If you're inside, you're part of it,"" Lapid said.

But with the virus crisis worsening, and his own shaky alliance fraying, Gantz made an about-face late last month and accepted an offer from Netanyahu to pursue a joint government to deal with the pandemic. The move drew heavy criticism from Gantz's supporters and tore apart his Blue and White alliance. Negotiations continued even after Gantz' allotted time to build a coalition ended last week. The Knesset, or parliament, had been given until May 7 to select a candidate for prime minister. Otherwise, it would automatically have been dissolved and triggered new elections. On Sunday night, several thousand demonstrators, including Gantz's former political partner Yair Lapid, gathered in Tel Aviv to protest the emerging deal. Protesters accused Netanyahu of using the coronavirus crisis to shield himself from prosecution and accused Gantz of abandoning his central campaign promises. ""You don't fight corruption from within. If you're inside, you're part of it,"" Lapid said.

He has denied any wrongdoing and portrays himself as a victim of a media and judicial witch hunt. Citing the coronavirus crisis, Netanyahu's hand-picked justice minister has already delayed the trial by two months by shuttering most of the court system. Israel has identified more than 13,000 cases of the coronavirus. While this week the country began relaxing some of its health restrictions, hundreds of thousands are out of work and the economy has come to a standstill.
