The app, which is available in Australia now through Apple's App Store and is expected to be in Google Play by the end of the week, provides children under 13 with a way to video chat with friends and family under remote parental supervision. It does not require kids to sign up for a Facebook account; instead parents use their own account and app to get their children set up and monitor who they talk to. Messenger Kids gives parents full control of their children's communication, Facebook says. While the app could be handy to provide kids with autonomy over when they chat to friends and family during home isolation, Australian privacy tech not-for-profit Loki Foundation has raised concerns about long term use. ""Facebook is the best company in the world at profiling people ... and the privacy policy they’ve put in place for Messenger Kids isn’t a very strong protection against a company geared towards collecting and using every last drop of information possible,"" Loki chief executive Simon Harman said. ""By locking kids into the Facebook ecosystem, parents are signing them up to be tracked and profiled. By the time these kids sign up for 'actual' Facebook, the company will already have a detailed social graph to utilise."" A spokesperson for Facebook said there were no ads or in-app purchases in the app, and data collected through the app was not used to target ads. Children are able to sign up for a full Facebook account once they are 13, but the company does not automatically convert Messenger Kids accounts to full Facebook accounts. The social media giant said it included strong privacy protections and consulted with a team of online safety and child development experts to develop and maintain the app. Parents can keep track of who their children are talking to, anyone they block and any images shared. The app puts parents in charge of who gets added as contacts. This could include adult family and friends — who can chat with the child through their standard Messenger app — or the children of friends who are also using Messenger Kids. An upcoming update will allow kids to be more active in finding and approving friends, but parents will be able to turn this off or overrule kids' decisions. Just last year Facebook was made to pay a $US5 billion fine for breaching user privacy, after data captured from Facebook accounts was used for illegal profiling by a third party. The Messenger Kids app was also in the news for privacy issues last year following its launch in the United States. A design flaw had allowed kids to join group chats with friends of friends who were not approved by parents. Since then the company has racheted up privacy and parent transparency in the app, while also adding features that teach kids about communicating responsibly online, but not everyone is convinced. ""It is great to see Facebook add more controls for parents under these recent updates,"" said Katis McInnis, policy counsel for Consumer Reports in the US, following Facebook's privacy-minded changes in February. ""That said, Parents should think carefully about whether they want their youngest kids on a messaging app at all, given past issues with Facebook's handling of personal data."" The Australian rollout of the app follows the introduction of Spotify Kids, which provides children with their own music library and playlists.

Early details paint a picture of significantly more powerful machines that can launch into the middle of a game in an instant, and work with many of the games you've amassed over the past six years. Specifically, here's what we know so far about the next generation of consoles, and then some speculation on which will end up being the more powerful. The PlayStation 5 DualSense. The PS5 has been confirmed for launch in ""holiday 2020"", but we still haven't seen what the machine looks like. We have, however, had a good look at the controller. Dropping the DualShock moniker Sony has used on and off since 1997, the DualSense looks like quite an ergonomic redesign with longer and more curved handles, but the same linear stick layout. The dual tone colour scheme is also pretty out there as far as standard pads go, which could give some idea as to the look of the system. The triggers have seen the most love in terms of new functionality, with additional haptic feedback motors and tech that allows developers to set the tension. That means the trigger could be easier or firmer to pull back depending on your in-game vehicle, weapon etc. There is also now a microphone and speaker embedded in the pad, so you can have quick chats with other players with no headset required. Finally the buttons and other inputs are largely the same as on the DualShock 4, though the Share button has been renamed ""Create"", indicating there may be more ways to package and broadcast your gameplay than simply posting screenshots or videos to Twitter. The official PS5 logo is very similar to that of the PS4. As for the internals of the machine itself, in March system architect Mark Cerny laid out the nerdy specs while leaving a lot of the more consumer-friendly details to our imaginations. Combined with the few tidbits we learned from earlier exclusive interviews with WIRED, we have a decent overview: Importantly Sony has committed to backwards compatibility, meaning your PS4 games and PSVR headset will work on PS5. However the more details about this that come out, the more questions there are. The PS5's custom GPU has legacy modes for PS4 and PS4 Pro, meaning those games might not be visually improved on the new console but they should work without too much developer tweaking. Yet Sony has stopped short of saying all PS4 games will work, confirming instead that ""most"" of the 100 best-selling titles would work at launch, with more to come. At this point PS3 and older compatibility seems unlikely, barring a cloud processing solution. In December, at The Game Awards, Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer unveiled the Xbox Series X; a tall black obelisk that more closely resembles a compact PC tower than a traditional console. The look reflects a change of focus at Xbox which has been taking place since Spencer took over in the middle of the current generation. Xbox is now less a line of machines and more an ecosystem of games you can access from any number of machines — including PCs and various consoles, and soon any device with a screen thanks to the cloud — and in some ways the Series X is merely a more powerful system in the same line as current Xbox devices. For example Microsoft isn't planning to make exclusive games for the Series X in the first year after the console launches; all its new games will work on the existing Xbox One as well. Additionally, every single game you own that works on Xbox One — including Xbox 360 and original Xbox games — should work on Series X and will be able to take advantage of its new tech for better load times, higher resolution, better frame rates and even HDR visuals (applied via an AI software solution). Microsoft has detailed a technology called Smart Delivery, in which games you've bought from the store will download in the appropriate format for your devices. For example if you buy Halo 5 on Xbox One, downloading it on Series X could get you a version totally reworked for that console rather than the Xbox One version, at no extra cost. Microsoft will use this mechanism for all its games, but says other developers may choose to sell separate Xbox One and Xbox Series X versions if they want (though both will work on Series X). As for the internals of the Series X, Spencer has detailed them fairly thoroughly: While Microsoft has said all Xbox One accessories will work on Series X, the console's hardware design would indicate the truth isn't so straightforward. There is no longer an HDMI-in, so if you're one of the few people running your TV set-top box through your console you may be disappointed. The optical audio port has also been ditched, leaving it unclear how headsets which rely on that will work with the Series X. There's also of course no Kinect port, and I'd be very surprised if the Series X will work with Microsoft's ill-fated depth camera/microphone even if you plugged one in with an adapter. All Xbox One controllers will work here, including the recent Elite Series 2, and the newly redesigned controller packaged with the Series X will play friendly with your old Xbox One too. The new controller has seen only slight tweaks in shape, with a new directional pad and share button the only obvious changes. Microsoft is working on improving latency between the controller and screen, and says Xbox One controllers will be able to reap the benefits via a software update. On paper the consoles are very similar, using the same architecture for their chips, packing the same amount of RAM and each with a cutting edge SSD for storage. Comparing the two really comes down to the nitty gritty. Both Sony's CPU and GPU operate a lot like a desktop processor; working at full speed when required and if it isn't getting too hot, and throttling back to cool or when there isn't much going on. The CPU's max frequency is 3.5Ghz. On the Xbox, the CPU will stay at either 3.8Ghz or 3.6Ghz depending on whether the developer has opted to use it in a single- or multi- thread mode. Either way, on paper, it's faster than PS5. On the GPU Sony's silicon packs fewer compute units but a faster frequency than Microsoft's, meaning the Series X again wins on raw power. Even for tasks that might benefit from the PS5's higher clocks, you again need to consider they will dip under high temperatures. A lot will depend on Sony's thermal design. So taking all the numbers at face value, the next-gen Xbox would offer a significant advantage over the next-gen PlayStation, but it's worth taking that conclusion with a grain of salt. For starters there's still a lot about the consoles we don't know, and there's always the X factor of what individual developers will manage to do within the limitations of hardware. The PlayStation 4 Pro is less powerful than the Xbox One X, for example, but it's a moot argument if you're comparing God of War to Crackdown 3. And then looking beyond power to which machine will be more popular, you have to consider how they'll be positioned in the market. If one is significantly less expensive then processing power might not factor in as much, while there are also rumours of a less expensive and less powerful ""Xbox Series S"", as well as a more powerful ""PlayStation 5 Pro"", which could even out the numbers. And in terms of games, which are always the most important factor, we're still yet to see much of a lineup from either side.

Well, in the 20 years since LG introduced the first smart fridge, tech companies have worked out what people actually want from smart products, beyond ""it connects to the internet, I guess"". To see what kinds of advancements have been made, and because my old dishwasher was an agent of chaos, I decked my apartment out with new smart appliances and discovered that it's the little things that make the most difference. The appliances I got were the $1749 LG XD3A25BS dishwasher and the $1439 WV9-1409W TwinWash washing machine. Neither of them have particularly flashy smart features: they don’t have TVs or anything like that. But their features are ones I have actually used, unlike the smart lights whose colours I never change. Tech companies have worked out what people actually want from smart products. Even without the smart features, this is a ridiculously good and intelligent washing machine. It’s got a big 9kg washer on top and a small 2kg washing drawer on the bottom for delicates, sportswear, or when you just really need to clean one particular outfit. With the smart features I can download new cycles; as I did to wash a blanket or a load of jeans. (It would be nice if brands could start making custom cycles that are particularly suited to their unusual fabrics, but presumably that feature could be added at any time.) Back in the before, when we could go out and do things, the remote start feature let me tell it to begin washing once I knew what time I’d get home. It’s also the little things, like getting the notification to my phoneasking whether I would like to add fabric softener (I would not, but appreciate being asked). The notification that the wash is done is particularly useful, because it stays on the lock screen until I address it, which means my clothes haven’t been left to go mouldy recently. The dishwasher is also amazing. Not just because it isn't operated by a dial of mystery like my old Smeg — 100 notches all the way around, but only one will clean the dishes, and there is no way to know which — it’s amazing because of its intelligent steaming function and movable top shelf. It’s also ridiculously quiet, to the point that I’m never 100 per cent sure it’s on, but the dishes come out clean anyway. The connected features on this are also fairly basic. I get a notification that the cycle is done, can remote start it, download new cycles, change the settings, be reminded when it needs to be cleaned or have more rinse aid, and diagnose any potential problems with it by holding my phone close. For most people, and most brands, it’s still the internet fridge that is the pinnacle of smart whitegoods. But those fridges only come in two sizes — stupidly large, and massive — and thus don't suit anyone with a family smaller than five. And, be honest, how often would you actually remember to check the camera inside your fridge? Would you rather watch that YouTube video on your fridge, which is usually in the corner of the kitchen, or on an iPad near where you’re actually cooking? For me, when it comes to smart home, it’s better to focus on the features that will actually be useful, rather than those that are needlessly flashy and jack the price up considerably. My time with these whitegoods has shown me that it’s the quiet, useful intelligence that really matters. Alice is a freelance journalist, producer and presenter.

A FitBit and a bit of encouragement can help inform healthy habits.Credit:Adam Turner Having worked from home for 15 years, I appreciate the importance of going for a walk every day; either along the creek near my house or, when the weather turns sour, on the treadmill. If I don't walk my back plays up, but walking is good for both body and mind. I've tested FitBits before but never really felt they were for me. Of course now my teenage kids are studying from home I'm ""encouraging"" — by which I mean pestering — them to develop healthy habits. To be honest we're not a sporty family at the best of times, and it can be a struggle to get everyone out of the house. When I first suggested we all get FitBit watches, I expected my family to put up a fight but thankfully they saw the wisdom in it. My wife and I opted for the first-gen FitBit Versa while the kids went for the more ostentatious FitBit Ionic. They're not the latest and greatest FitBit models, but we got them at a good price and they're more than enough to meet our needs. So far it's worked even better than I'd hoped. It's been much easier to get the kids outside for a walk. If they miss my lunchtime walk, they're voluntarily jumping on the treadmill in the evening – something I never thought I'd see. They're also burning off energy with a good cardio session playing Just Dance on the Wii. It turns out the trick for my family is turning it into a competition – unlocking achievement badges and becoming FitBit buddies so we can see each other's steps. I'd say it's less about beating everyone else and more about feeling that you're responsible to someone so you don't want to let down the team. Now we're now stuck at home we're actually exercising more than ever, developing good habits which hopefully will help keep us fit once we're free to leave the house whenever we want.

It turns out the trick for my family is turning it into a competition – unlocking achievement badges and becoming FitBit buddies so we can see each other's steps. I'd say it's less about beating everyone else and more about feeling that you're responsible to someone so you don't want to let down the team. Now we're now stuck at home we're actually exercising more than ever, developing good habits which hopefully will help keep us fit once we're free to leave the house whenever we want.

10,/technology/how-dropbox-and-australian-hackers-uncovered-zoom-s-biggest-flaws-20200421-p54lo7.html,"How Dropbox, and Australian hackers, uncovered Zoom's biggest flaws","One year ago, two Australian hackers found themselves on an eight-hour flight to Singapore to attend a live hacking competition sponsored by Dropbox. At 30,000 feet, with nothing but a slow internet connection, they decided to get a head start by hacking Zoom, a videoconferencing service that they knew was used by many Dropbox employees. The hackers soon uncovered a major security vulnerability in Zoom's software that could have allowed attackers to covertly control certain users' Mac computers. It was precisely the type of bug that security engineers at Dropbox had come to dread from Zoom, according to three former Dropbox engineers. Replay   Now Zoom's videoconferencing service has become the preferred communications platform for hundreds of millions of people sheltering at home, and reports of its privacy and security troubles have proliferated. Zoom's defenders, including big-name Silicon Valley venture capitalists, say the onslaught of criticism is unfair. They argue that Zoom, originally designed for businesses, could not have anticipated a pandemic that would send legions of consumers flocking to its service in the span of a few weeks and using it for purposes — like primary school classes and family celebrations — for which it was never intended. ""I don't think a lot of these things were predictable,"" said Alex Stamos, a former chief security officer at Facebook who recently signed on as a security adviser to Zoom. ""It's like everyone decided to drive their cars on water."" The former Dropbox engineers, however, say Zoom's current woes can be traced back two years or more, and they argue that the company's failure to overhaul its security practices back then put its business clients at risk. Dropbox grew so concerned that vulnerabilities in the videoconferencing system might compromise its own corporate security that the file-hosting giant took on the unusual step of policing Zoom's security practices itself, according to the former engineers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to publicly discuss their work. As part of a novel security assessment program for its vendors and partners, Dropbox in 2018 began privately offering rewards to top hackers to find holes in Zoom's software code and that of a few other companies. The former Dropbox engineers said they were stunned by the volume and severity of the security flaws that hackers discovered in Zoom's code; and troubled by Zoom's slowness in fixing them. After Dropbox presented the hackers' findings from the Singapore event to Zoom Video Communications, the California company behind the videoconferencing service, it took more than three months for Zoom to fix the bug, the former engineers said. Zoom patched the vulnerability only after another hacker publicised a different security flaw with the same root cause. Zoom's sudden popularity — nearly 600,000 people downloaded the app on a single day last month — has opened it to increased scrutiny by researchers and journalists and forced the company to grapple with a rash of security incidents. Three weeks ago in the US, the FBI warned that it had received multiple reports of trolls hijacking public school classes on Zoom to display pornography and make threats; malicious attacks known as ""Zoombombing."" Last week, Vice's Motherboard blog reported that security bug brokers were selling access — for $US500,000 — to critical Zoom security flaws that could allow remote access into users' computers. Separately, hackers put up more than half a million Zoom users' passwords and user names for sale on the so-called dark web. On April 1 Eric Yuan, Zoom's chief executive, said the company would devote all of its engineering resources for the next 90 days to shoring up security and privacy. Last week, the company announced a revamped reward program for hackers who find security flaws in its code. Stamos said Zoom was also working on design changes to reduce the potential risks of security flaws and abuses like Zoombombing. Even critics acknowledge that Zoom remains the most user-friendly videoconferencing service on the market and has become a crucial communications tool during the pandemic. Security researchers also praised Zoom for improving its response times; quickly patching recent bugs and removing features that presented privacy risks to consumers. Zoom is hardly the first tech company whose sudden surge in popularity exposed its problems. Microsoft, Twitter, Google, Facebook and Uber have all settled charges related to consumer security or privacy. What is different about Zoom is the unusual role that another tech company — Dropbox — played in pushing the videoconferencing service to address its security weaknesses. Details on Dropbox's role have not been publicly reported before. Many companies, including Zoom, have ""bug bounty programs"" in which they pay hackers to turn over flaws in the company's own software code. But Dropbox, which has integrated its file-sharing services with Zoom, did something novel. Starting in 2018, Dropbox privately offered to pay top hackers it regularly worked with to find problems with Zoom's software. It even had its own security engineers confirm the bugs and look for related problems before passing them on to Zoom, according to the former Dropbox engineers. Hackers have reported several dozen problems with Zoom to Dropbox, the former employees said. These included moderate problems, like the ability for attackers to take over users' actions on the Zoom web app, and more serious security flaws like the ability for attackers to run malicious code on computers using Zoom software. Dropbox also put in its own controls to ensure that its integration with Zoom did not present risks to Dropbox users. In early 2019, Dropbox sponsored HackerOne Singapore, the live hacking competition. To put pressure on Zoom to take security more seriously, former Dropbox engineers said, Dropbox included the videoconferencing service among companies for which it offered bug bounties at the event. Even before the event began, one hacker reported a major vulnerability to Dropbox that could have allowed attackers to pose as Zoom over Wi-Fi and secretly observe users' video calls, the former Dropbox engineers said. Soon after, the two Australian hackers — an engineer and executive at Brisbane-based Assetnote, a security company — uncovered the flaw that would have allowed an attacker to covertly take complete control of certain computers running Apple's macOS, according to a blog post published by the hackers. The discovery was particularly jarring because attackers could have used the Zoom vulnerability to gain access to the deepest levels of a user's computer. But Zoom did not quickly address the flaw. Instead, the company waited more than three months until a third researcher independently uncovered and publicised a separate, less serious issue, with the same underlying cause. Yuan, Zoom's chief executive, subsequently wrote a blog post in July apologising for the delay. ""We misjudged the situation and did not respond quickly enough — and that's on us,"" Yuan wrote. He added: ""We take user security incredibly seriously."" The New York Times Copyright © 2020"," Natasha Singer , Nicole Perlroth ","April 21, 2020"

12,/technology/video-games/resident-evil-renaissance-continues-with-another-grisly-revival-20200414-p54jkv.html,Resident Evil renaissance continues with another grisly revival,"Last year's incredible reimagining of Resident Evil 2 set a high bar with its tense, claustrophobic, visually stunning and gruesomely gory zombie rollercoaster. And while the followup isn't as meaty or impactful, Resident Evil 3 is still a masterful remake and a welcome return to the terrifying streets of Raccoon City. Everything about the 1999 game has been rethought and expanded here, from the narrative to the locales to the combat, and the result is an experience which — while set in the delightfully analogue '90s — transforms the old ideas and characters into something that looks and feels incredible in 2020. The action spills out onto the zombie-infested streets in Resident Evil 3. The events of RE3 happen concurrently with RE2; while Leon and Claire delve into the secrets beneath the police department, as seen in last year's remake, out on the streets another story is unfolding. Jill Valentine — protagonist of the original Resident Evil — has left the force after uncovering the horrifying truth about pharmaceutical giant Umbrella, only to watch the authorities do nothing about it. Now, as she continues to dig for evidence, she's pursued by a seemingly unstoppable bioweapon designed to silence her as more and more citizens become deadly zombies. As with last year's game, RE3 inherits the darkly beautiful visual and audio style originally built for Resident Evil 7, meaning everything from the zombie's off-screen howling to the way bullets rip chunks out of their shambling bodies is at once disturbing and glorious. This is a decidedly more action-focused game than its predecessor, as you leave behind the confines of RE2's mansion-like police headquarters and enter the city at large. Filled with hastily abandoned stores, overturned cars and crowds of zombies, the setting allows for a broader look at the fictional (but occasionally still confronting) viral crisis, while also injecting more chases and explosions into the mix. Yet the streets also function as a kind of overworld connecting multiple smaller labyrinths of creepy hallways and unsettling creatures. Unwitting Umbrella goon Carlos has his role expanded in this new version of the story. From a power station that's been converted into a grotesque nest for parasite-spewing spiders to an abandoned hospital where things have visibly taken a turn for the worse, these areas lack the depth of the police station but make up for that with variety, and there's still plenty of the series' trademark holding-your-breath-while-turning-the-corner moments. The blend of familiar horror elements and more action-inspired additions continues through to the actual gameplay, where the over-the-shoulder exploration and combat is a little less tense and a little more empowering this time around. Ammo is more plentiful for example, and Jill has a handy dodge move that can let you sprint through a crowd of zombies if you're fast (and lucky). Unlike the sinister Tyrant of RE2, Nemesis will come at you with conventional weapons like a rocket launcher. But there's enough survival horror secret sauce to prevent the game going too far away from its roots. You still need to scour environments and solve puzzles to access tools, powerful weapons and the more exotic ammo types (which are still scarce enough that you need to be careful), and I love the old-school feeling of knowing you can miss powerful upgrades if you're not paying attention. As with RE2 there are also some old school elements that are less welcome, such as the lack of temporary space in your inventory that means you'll end up throwing away useful items if you don't want to trudge back to a save point. With a similar look and feel to last year's game and a comparatively short running time (my first run took me seven hours, but my second only four), a cynic might say the only reason RE3 is a full game and not downloadable content for RE2 is that Capcom wanted to charge full price. But the focus on action over puzzles and exploration — as well as certain elements unlocked once you finish the game — does encourage experimentation and repeat playthroughs. There's also a fun but flawed multiplayer mode which sees teams work together to take on villains controlled by a solo ""mastermind"" player. Overall this game could be seen as a missed opportunity to flesh out what was — in 1999 — a quick but quirky followup to the more substantial RE3. But from the insane locations and intriguing characters to the stunning looks and satisfying action, this is a stellar game in its own right, and that can't be ignored.

14,/technology/fortnite-not-silicon-valley-leads-race-to-build-next-gen-web-20200420-p54lel.html,"Fortnite, not Silicon Valley, leads race to build next gen web","The next version of the internet is often described as the Metaverse, a term borne from science fiction, describing a shared, virtual space that's persistently online and active, even without people logging in. It will have its own economy, complete with jobs, shopping areas and media to consume. The Metaverse is inevitable, many believe, and the Silicon Valley C-suite has been obsessed with the idea; as has a video game company in North Carolina. In recent years, there's been serious talk about how to build the Metaverse, and who will build it first. One only needs to witness Facebook and Google's internet success today, given how both companies dominate digital business, to understand the eagerness with which companies hurry to populate this next frontier. In observing that pursuit, there's the very real possibility that Fortnite, the video game that became a global phenomenon that turned celebrities into players and players into celebrities, has been building the foundations of the internet's future right before our glazed eyes. A new Punk'd reboot was screened inside of Fortnite. Fortnite's creators at Epic Games have not been shy about this ambition. Its CEO, Tim Sweeney, wants this conversation in public, and has made overt references in the last few years in establishing Fortnite as something more than a game. He's even hinted that this transformation could begin by the end of this year. Conversation around a more tangible, actualized internet seems only more pointed in light of our current stay-at-home reality in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In the past month, office culture has coalesced around video chat platforms like Zoom, while personal cultural milestones like weddings and graduations are being conducted in Nintendo's Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Metaverse not only seems realistic - it would probably be pretty useful right about now. The Metaverse reality is still years, possibly decades, away. But Sweeney has been publicly pushing for its creation, and he isn't alone in his desire to push for the Metaverse, where the online world echoes and fulfills real-world needs and activities. Constructing the virtual internet space is Silicon Valley's macro goal, many of whom are obsessed with Neal Stephenson's 1992 book, Snow Crash, which defined the term. In recent years, Facebook, Google and Samsung have all made heavy investments in cloud computing and virtual reality companies in anticipation of a Metaverse. Facebook Horizon, launched in 2019, is a virtual reality social space intended to serve as a Metaverse. Google's shared workspace tools, powered by its cloud computing investments over the years, were all small but significant steps to institutionalize work culture online. But it's Fortnite that has the most viable path forward in terms of creating the Metaverse, according to an essay by venture capitalist and former Amazon executive Matthew Ball. And if today's internet dystopia scares you, the Metaverse will only make things more complicated. Although Fortnite's entry into the Metaverse race was all by accident, the gaming industry has been tackling the possibility of creating it for years. ""We're seeing this advancement of technology and internet interaction and the Metaverse coming from gaming because it tends to be at the forefront of something designed for many, and who have the highest [technological] needs,"" Ball said in an interview. The most widely agreed core attributes of a Metaverse include always being live and persistent — with both planned and spontaneous events always occurring — while at the same time providing an experience that spans and operates across platforms and the real world. A Metaverse must also have no real cap on audience, and have its own fully functioning economy. In 2017, Fortnite was created to be a four-player cooperative game about defending a base; a classic popular game type. The Battle Royale mode, which brought the game global success, was grafted on later, after the genre gained ground in the PC market. Through 2018, Fortnite developed a reputation as less of a video game, and more as Gen Z's preferred social platform. It has featured live events that have sparked intrigue both in-game (as when cataclysmic events altered the game's map) and in the real world (when the game made headlines by disappearing into a black hole for two days in October to reset its servers for its second chapter). And all of those elements have prompted players to drop hundreds of millions on V-Bucks, Fortnite's in-game currency, which in turn brought Epic hundreds of millions in real-world revenue. Epic Games never planned for Fortnite to become such a cultural touchstone, not to the point that it inspired everything from World Cup celebrations to Netflix considering the game, not rival streaming platforms, its biggest competitor. Fortnite hasn't reached Metaverse status yet. But Fortnite as a social network and impossible-to-ignore cultural phenomenon, Ball says, provides Epic Games a key advantage for leading in the Metaverse race. Fortnite draws a massive, willing and excited audience online to engage with chaotically clashing intellectual properties. For now, it's the only legal place on the internet where a Netflix-approved avatar of Hopper from Stranger Things can twerk on a Disney-approved avatar of Rey Skywalker from Star Wars. ""This organic evolution can't be overemphasized,"" Ball writes in his essay. ""If you 'declared' your intent to start a Metaverse, these parties would never embrace interoperability or entrust their IP. But Fortnite has become so popular and so unique that most counterparties have no choice but to participate. . . . Fortnite is too valuable a platform."" The current pandemic may inspire more ideas contributing to the Metaverse, Ball said. Already, the crisis has drawn attention to gated off attempts to create smaller, focused Metaverse communities. A virtual reality church driven by a megachurch pastor in Pennysylvania has been in service for some years now, but has recently gained media attention due to the coronavirus crisis. ""This, whether in direct articulation or not, will drive a lot more funding [for the Metaverse], and thinking most of all,"" Ball said. The current swarm to an online-only social and capitalist economy has only highlighted the current internet's failings, and what the Metaverse needs to do, Ball said. Big sites like Facebook, Google and Amazon continue to dominate online activity, as do larger streaming services like YouTube and Netflix. But each location requires its own membership and has separate ecosystems. ""Right now, the digital world basically operates as though every restaurant and bar you go to requires a different ID card, has a different currency, requires their own dress codes and has their own units [of service and measurement],"" Ball said. ""It is clear that this really advantages the biggest services. People are just sticking to the big games, really. However there's a clear argument that reducing network lock-in can really raise all boats here."" Sweeney said as much in his DICE Summit keynote speech in February. If the game industry wants to reshape the internet and move away from Silicon Valley's walled gardens, Sweeney stressed that publishers need to rethink economies in the same way email was standardized. In email's early days, different companies would have proprietary messaging systems that only worked for internal communication. ""Somebody introduced the @ sign in email addresses, so now I can be Tim@Epic and I could talk to Tim@Microsoft or Tim@Sony,"" Sweeney said. ""That involved everybody with their own proprietary systems agreeing to connect to everybody else's systems. This critically needs to happen in gaming. We need to give up our attempts to each create our own private walled gardens and private monopoly and agree to work together and recognize we're all far better off if we connect our systems and grow our social graphs together."" The Metaverse may be decades away from being built. But as the world waits at home, quietly but slowly realizing the potential of a more robust, engaging online experience, Fortnite continues to lay the foundations of one, slowly but surely. In the midst of the pandemic, April saw the launch of a new streaming service, Quibi, backed by investments from Disney, NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS. The company's marketing strategy included streaming its reboot of Punk'd starring Chance the Rapper to Fortnite players at the Risky Reels venue. As players logged on to watch the show inside the game, other players started to build their forts to block the screen. Any openings left were pelted by tomatoes. It was a stark reminder that even though the Metaverse may evolve the internet, the way we behave on it may not be so easily changed.

""We're seeing this advancement of technology and internet interaction and the Metaverse coming from gaming because it tends to be at the forefront of something designed for many, and who have the highest [technological] needs,"" Ball said in an interview. The most widely agreed core attributes of a Metaverse include always being live and persistent — with both planned and spontaneous events always occurring — while at the same time providing an experience that spans and operates across platforms and the real world. A Metaverse must also have no real cap on audience, and have its own fully functioning economy. In 2017, Fortnite was created to be a four-player cooperative game about defending a base; a classic popular game type. The Battle Royale mode, which brought the game global success, was grafted on later, after the genre gained ground in the PC market. Through 2018, Fortnite developed a reputation as less of a video game, and more as Gen Z's preferred social platform. It has featured live events that have sparked intrigue both in-game (as when cataclysmic events altered the game's map) and in the real world (when the game made headlines by disappearing into a black hole for two days in October to reset its servers for its second chapter). And all of those elements have prompted players to drop hundreds of millions on V-Bucks, Fortnite's in-game currency, which in turn brought Epic hundreds of millions in real-world revenue. Epic Games never planned for Fortnite to become such a cultural touchstone, not to the point that it inspired everything from World Cup celebrations to Netflix considering the game, not rival streaming platforms, its biggest competitor. Fortnite hasn't reached Metaverse status yet. But Fortnite as a social network and impossible-to-ignore cultural phenomenon, Ball says, provides Epic Games a key advantage for leading in the Metaverse race. Fortnite draws a massive, willing and excited audience online to engage with chaotically clashing intellectual properties. For now, it's the only legal place on the internet where a Netflix-approved avatar of Hopper from Stranger Things can twerk on a Disney-approved avatar of Rey Skywalker from Star Wars. ""This organic evolution can't be overemphasized,"" Ball writes in his essay. ""If you 'declared' your intent to start a Metaverse, these parties would never embrace interoperability or entrust their IP. But Fortnite has become so popular and so unique that most counterparties have no choice but to participate. . . . Fortnite is too valuable a platform."" The current pandemic may inspire more ideas contributing to the Metaverse, Ball said. Already, the crisis has drawn attention to gated off attempts to create smaller, focused Metaverse communities. A virtual reality church driven by a megachurch pastor in Pennysylvania has been in service for some years now, but has recently gained media attention due to the coronavirus crisis. ""This, whether in direct articulation or not, will drive a lot more funding [for the Metaverse], and thinking most of all,"" Ball said. The current swarm to an online-only social and capitalist economy has only highlighted the current internet's failings, and what the Metaverse needs to do, Ball said. Big sites like Facebook, Google and Amazon continue to dominate online activity, as do larger streaming services like YouTube and Netflix. But each location requires its own membership and has separate ecosystems. ""Right now, the digital world basically operates as though every restaurant and bar you go to requires a different ID card, has a different currency, requires their own dress codes and has their own units [of service and measurement],"" Ball said. ""It is clear that this really advantages the biggest services. People are just sticking to the big games, really. However there's a clear argument that reducing network lock-in can really raise all boats here."" Sweeney said as much in his DICE Summit keynote speech in February. If the game industry wants to reshape the internet and move away from Silicon Valley's walled gardens, Sweeney stressed that publishers need to rethink economies in the same way email was standardized. In email's early days, different companies would have proprietary messaging systems that only worked for internal communication. ""Somebody introduced the @ sign in email addresses, so now I can be Tim@Epic and I could talk to Tim@Microsoft or Tim@Sony,"" Sweeney said. ""That involved everybody with their own proprietary systems agreeing to connect to everybody else's systems. This critically needs to happen in gaming. We need to give up our attempts to each create our own private walled gardens and private monopoly and agree to work together and recognize we're all far better off if we connect our systems and grow our social graphs together."" The Metaverse may be decades away from being built. But as the world waits at home, quietly but slowly realizing the potential of a more robust, engaging online experience, Fortnite continues to lay the foundations of one, slowly but surely. In the midst of the pandemic, April saw the launch of a new streaming service, Quibi, backed by investments from Disney, NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS. The company's marketing strategy included streaming its reboot of Punk'd starring Chance the Rapper to Fortnite players at the Risky Reels venue. As players logged on to watch the show inside the game, other players started to build their forts to block the screen. Any openings left were pelted by tomatoes. It was a stark reminder that even though the Metaverse may evolve the internet, the way we behave on it may not be so easily changed.

Contact tracing involves identifying and following up with people who may have come in contact with an infectious disease. New digital solutions aim to do this by exchanging beacons between phones when two people are close together, via Bluetooth. Using phones to trace contact between people could have privacy risks, but it also could make a big difference in limiting the spread of the virus.Credit:Glenn Hunt The federal government has confirmed that its forthcoming app will be based on Singapore’s TraceTogether, which has been criticised over its need to be open and active on a user's phone to work. Solutions in other countries have involved storing tracing data and user phone numbers on central databases, prompting concerns from security and privacy advocates. Marc Rogers, organiser of the world’s largest hacking conference DEF CON and executive director of identity security company Okta, said Apple and Google’s offering provided more protection. ""The Google and Apple method is completely decentralised. The only security issues appear when a person [with a positive diagnosis] decides to upload their information. And even then they're not huge,"" he says. ""It's better designed and far more likely to produce the results they're hoping for."" Replay   Though the Attorney-General is still overseeing the exact methodology to be used in the local version, Prime Minister Scott Morrison suggested on Thursday the government was not won over by Apple and Google’s proposal. ""The Google and the Apple proposal does exactly the same thing, it’s just not a consent based model. The TraceTogether app, which has been put in place in Singapore, is a consent based model,” Mr Morrison said. Apple and Google maintain their method is in fact consent based. It will be distributed first as an API that can be used by any public health app, such as Australia’s. In the coming months it will become part of the iOS and Android operating systems, so if a user opts in tracing can occur without an app being required. The companies' method keeps tracing data on each individual user’s phone until they recieve a positive diagnosis and consent to having it transmitted. It contains no personal or identifying information. Mr Rogers said that a decentralised solution that's largely offline and will eventually work on all smartphones without the need for an app would encourage more Australians to sign up to the app. A high adoption rate by the public is vital for digital contact tracing to work. An international research project, surveying 1000 Australians on their view on digital tracing , found 70 per cent would download and use a government tracing app. But one of the project leaders warned in reality the number wouldn't be that high. ""The stated intention to download an app is not the same thing as actually doing it. And so, you would expect that the percentage of people who will actually do it will be somewhat lower,"" Melbourne University's Simon Dennis said. ""There's a degree of uncertainty about whether [the government’s app] is going to work."" Mr Rogers said that regardless of the methodology used to build the app and the urgent need to deliver it to the public, having an open conversation on its privacy implications was critical. ""Having this capability out there, it's going to be very tempting for law enforcement and other groups to use this to track people to prevent crime and such, because it will be a phenomenal tool for that kind of thing,"" he said.

18,/technology/cutting-the-cord-with-dyson-s-699-hair-straightener-20200415-p54k3x.html,Cutting the cord with Dyson's $699 hair straightener,"Dyson says its new cordless straightener can reduce hair damage by eliminating the need to go over the same tress multiple times. But is the Corrale, arriving in Australia next month, worth $699? My hair is naturally pretty curly, so I rarely try to straighten it. It’s also got more than 20 years of colour damage. What I’m saying is that any kind of hair device has to be pretty great to work with the disaster I present it with. Dyson's Corrale will be available in Australia next month. That’s what made it so impressive when, at a Dyson event last year, a stylist coached me to use the Corrale to give me a mixture of beachy waves and ringlets. More impressive still, that styling lasted about two and a half days. The device gets the styles to stay by using less heat than other straighteners and ensuring that the heat is regulated. It also employs flexible plates to ensure the whole section of hair gets an even amount of heat, avoiding flyaways. Those flexible plates also mean you can apply less force to keep everything together, which is good because force is another thing that can cause damage. But since we don't all have professional hair stylists at home, I've been testing the Corrale to see if I can get the same kind of results consistently on my own. I've also been comparing it with the $119 Formwell X Kendall Jenner hair straightener we have at home, since $699 is extremely expensive for a hair straightener. Half way there.Credit:Alice Clarke The first thing I noticed was how much more robust and solid the Corrale was compared to the thin plastic feel of the Formwell. The second was how quickly the Dyson heated up; less than 30 seconds versus close to a minute. According to the hair-type chart and recommendations from Dyson I should be using 185 degrees, but that didn’t give me the straight result I was after so I had to go up to 210. It felt comfortable and straightened the right side of my hair in around 10 minutes. Having not a cord made it a lot easier to wrangle, and Dyson says a full charge is good for 30 minutes of straightening. When it came time to do the left side with the Formwell, 210 degrees was way too hot and caused my hair to smoke. Going back down to 190 left me with a bunch of flyaways, and looked dull and sad after 10 minutes. Touching the top of the two devices at 210 degrees was also a very different experience. I was able to keep my finger on the Dyson for a few seconds before it felt uncomfortable — so I could hold it in a way that gave me more control while curling my wife’s hair — and it didn’t burn my ear. If I touched the top of the Formwell it instantly felt like I was burning my finger, and my left ear still smarts hours later. The style the Formwell gave me was perfectly fine, but given how plastic it feels I'd be surprised if the straightener lasted more than two years. Meanwhile the Dyson was solid and has been tested to last for more than two 30-minute styling sessions every day for five years. Whether that’s worth $700 is up to you, but this is certainly, without a doubt, one of the best hair appliances I've ever used. Alice is a freelance journalist, producer and presenter.

20,/technology/apple-s-cheapest-iphone-offers-an-upgrade-at-the-right-price-20200416-p54kda.html,Apple's cheapest iPhone offers an upgrade at the right price,"Apple's new iPhone SE was given an uncharacteristically muted launch overnight, owing to the impracticality of holding a big event amid a global pandemic, but even a less expensive version of the modern iPhone isn't exactly a steal for Australian consumers. This is Apple's second version of the SE and like the 2016 model it takes new components and stuffs them into an older, smaller body to create a reasonably priced phone that offers solid performance. In this case, the latest SE is an iPhone 11 jammed into the modified chassis of an iPhone 8. Replay   In the US the new SE costs the same as the old one, but a weaker Aussie dollar means that here the starting price is bumped up from $679 to $749. The SE will be on sale from Apple's online store next Friday April 24, with yet-to-be-named ""select carriers"" also offering it on plans. If the base 64GB of storage isn't enough for you, you can get 128GB for $829 or 256GB for $999. So who is the SE for? Those who want the biggest and the best are unlikely to go back to a smaller display, while those in the market for a $300 outright phone won't be able to come up to $749. But in the middle are people looking for a sub-$1000 phone who would usually choose an older model or second hand iPhone, or a premium mid-range Android. Now they have an Apple option that doesn't come with an ageing processor, meaning it can run the latest apps and — importantly for Apple — get the most out of new features like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. At $749 the iPhone SE is miles ahead of the more expensive iPhone 8 it replaces in Apple's official lineup, let alone the comparatively ancient iPhone 7, which still goes for $600 at some retailers. In fact if you ignore the size of the display (the SE has a 4.7-inch screen, a sub-high definition (HD) resolution and returns to a Home button with Touch ID rather than face scanning), the less expensive iPhone can hold its own against its most recent siblings, packing the iPhone 11's A13 Bionic processor. The camera has been scaled back to a single lens but the new processor delivers just enough of the modern iPhone photography experience. The iPhone SE comes in black, white and red. Proceeds from the red model go to Global Fund's COVID-19 Responde Fund. While Apple would have planned this release well before COVID-19 took hold, it may turn out to be the best possible time for the launch. With the current crisis affecting many livelihoods the amount of money people are willing to spend on a new phone has dropped, yet the need to spend almost all of our leisure time indoors and potentially work from home has also increased our reliance on the devices. Recent data from GlobalWebIndex indicates that 46 per cent of Australians are using their smartphones more since the start of the outbreak, with the number at 76 per cent globally. Presumably many users with ailing old batteries, sluggish performance issues or smashed screens are open to upgrading at the right price. With hardware sales slowing and disposable income harder to come by, Apple needs to make sure as many people as possible have the gear to access its subscription TV, games and news services. The latest SE could be the device that hits the sweet spot both for Apple and consumers. For those open to either an iOS or Android device, Apple is entering into a premium mid-range space that has exploded in the past 12 months. Google really kicked things off with the $649 Pixel 3a, but more recently phones like the Samsung Galaxy A71 have shown just how close a sub-$1000 phone can get to the look and feel of a flagship. At the $500 level, Chinese operators like Realme with its XT and TCL with the Plex make the SE look old with their incredible displays and huge clusters of cameras. But none of those phones offer a processor as advanced as the one in the SE — so for example games might be bigger and brighter on the Realme but will actually run better on the iPhone — and they all lack wireless charging and water resistance, which the new iPhone has, making the SE a competitor in the overall mid-range space as well as the less-expensive iPhone space.
