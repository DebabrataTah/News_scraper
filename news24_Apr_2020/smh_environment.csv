The moves were flagged last November but have been given greater urgency as the government seeks ways to ignite economic growth once the COVID-19 lockdowns ease. Until now, residents wanting solar panel systems of greater than 10 kiloWatt capacity first needed council approval.Credit:Nick Moir Existing rules require residents to get council approval if they want to install solar photovoltaic systems of more than 10-kilowatt capacity. Residential zones, such as aged care home, were also limited to 100kW systems. Under the changes to the State Environmental Planning Policy for infrastructure, those rules have been relaxed. It is hoped the changes will increase flexibility so people can install new and more efficient PV systems on the roofs of commercial premises. “These changes ensure planning requirements are aligned with advances in technology, and enable emerging energy projects to progress through the planning system more efficiently,” Mr Stokes said. The amendments are the first the state government has made designed to speed the take-up of low-carbon technologies as part of the economic recovery from the corona virus shutdown. The NSW environment minister Matt Kean said changes were ""great news"" for customers and the industry, and would help support new energy generation projects funded through the government's $75 million Emerging Energy Program. “Over the past five years, wind and solar electricity generation has almost tripled,"" Mr Kean said, adding that almost half a million homes now had solar PV. ""These planning changes are an important next step to help innovative electricity projects like big batteries, higher capacity solar and wind come online sooner and lower energy bills.” So far the state has lagged in is the introduction of large batteries such as South Australia's 100 megawatt-sized Hornsdale Power Reserve, which is already proving a financial success and Victoria following suit with their own big batteries. The SEPP amendments recognise large-scale electricity storage will play an increasing role in the transition to renewable energy. The changes will enable utility providers to construct electricity storage as part of improvement works to transmission and distribution networks, and allow for large-scale battery storage systems to be built in permitted zones across NSW, the government said in a statement. In a November report on the proposed changes, the Planning Department said its energy division had already received as many as 15 applications for grant funding of standalone battery projects under the $75 million program.

March levels of particulate air pollution tiny enough to enter lungs and bloodstream were lower than for the same month in recent years, and far lower than during last summer's bushfires. The COVID-19 virus, which has curbed air and road traffic, played a part in the drop.   Average monthly figures measuring particulates of 2.5 microns or smaller - millionths of a metre - fell sharply in February and March from the previous months, according to the Environment Energy and Science unit of the Environment Department. In sites such as Randwick in the east, Macquarie Park in the north and Liverpool in the south, readings averaged between 4-6 per cubic metre in those two months, compared with 20-30 or higher in December when bushfires raged near the city. Late 2017 was the last time the sites had similarly low readings. The latest figures compare with a background level of about 5 per cubic metre, and the national health standard of 25. During the height of the bushfires average daily reading exceeded 150 in places such as Liverpool in December, the data shows. Reduced traffic was one factor in cutting levels of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, as were more natural influences. ""Weather conditions in NSW since late February 2020 have favoured good air quality - with rain, regular wind changes and fewer days of extreme temperatures,"" an Environment Department spokesman said. ""An assessment of recent carbon monoxide (CO) pollution for 1 March to 8 April at sites in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong show some reduction in pollution when compared to the same weeks in previous years,"" he said. ""CO levels in NSW are well below national standards and there are many periods where the monitoring instruments are measuring at or near their minimum detection limit [of] 0.05 parts per million."" The spell of unusually clear air, though, will likely be disrupted for a few days at least as agencies ramp up prescribed burning as they attempt to reduce fuel loads before next spring's fire season. A ""substantial"" fire is planned for the Hornsby area this weekend, an RFS spokesperson said. ""The window of opportunity [for hazard-reduction burning] seems to be getting smaller each year, "" she said. ""So it's important to make the most"" of the ideal conditions, including light winds. Coal-fired power plants are another source of pollution that can end up in the Sydney Basin. Recent weeks have also seen a reduction in output as power stations undergo maintenance after the utilities ran hard during the summer, according to Hugh Saddler, honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. Over the past four weeks, two of the four units at AGL's Liddell plant were out, while one of the four at the nearby Bayswater power station has also been offline lately, he said. Easter Saturday was particularly notable with renewable energy supplying a record share of more than half of the power for the National Electricity Market for about four hours during the day.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) intervened last September to slash the amount of power entering the grid from the plants - which have a rated capacity of 350 megawatts - because ""unprecedented technical issues"" threatened its stability. The Broken Hill solar farm has been affected by transmission constraints. Testing this week will determine whether the plant - and four others in Victoria - can resume full output to the grid. Regulators have tested the performance of individual plants - four of which are in Victoria and the other in Broken Hill - after engineers used a technical fix to smooth the energy output from the plants and make them more compatible with the grid. Tests involving all five plants began on Monday and will continue this week to ensure grid stability can handle the resumption of their full output, according to AEMO and company officials. Scott Partlin, an executive with SMA Australia which supplied inverters to the five farms, said AEMO had been working for months with generators and technology firms to have the curtailment issue resolved as soon as this Friday. The fix was part of a ""wholesale change of rules"" that was needed to ensure the grid could accommodate a rapid influx of low-cost and rapidly built solar and wind farms, he said. ""If we're going to see a renewable energy transition, this [temporary curb on supply] will not be the only time it happens,"" Mr Partlin said. AEMO's chief system design and engineering officer Alex Wonhas said the regulator had worked with partners to solve voltage oscillations detected in the region that were ""an Australian-first technical challenge"". ""If successful, [the tests] will allow AEMO to lift the constraints we had to impose and progress assessments of new generation projects in the West Murray Zone,"" he said. ""This will lay the foundation for an energy system that is not only delivering affordable outcomes for consumers but also making a substantial contribution to the reduction of emissions from the energy sector."" Director of the Clean Energy Council's Energy Transformation group Lillian Patterson said a lifting of the curtailment would be ""excellent news"".

An executive with one solar firm who asked not to be named said AEMO had originally stated the curtailment issue would be resolved ""in a few weeks"". The executive said the finances of constrained power plants ""have been crippled"", and ""their only crime was to follow through on the connection agreement"" granted by AEMO. The additional electricity would also have come in handy during the recent summer when supplies were tight. AEMO's shift to assessing applications one by one, to avoid a repeat of creating excessive intermittent load in one part of the grid, was now holding up many millions of dollars of investment, deterring future investors. ""There are a further 17 to 18 plants that are either completed, under construction, or 'committed' that will undergo the sequential ... registration process,"" the executive said.

Her home and nursery in Wandella in southern NSW reduced to rubble, Ms Roberts fled to Canberra, powerless to act as fires threatened another venture in nearby Pialligo. Living in the smoke-choked capital also damaged her vocal cords, which have still not recovered. Lisa Roberts and her partner lost their home and nursery in Wandella in summer's bushfires, prompting her to lead a novel legal case against the NSW Environment Protection Authority.Credit:Lisa Roberts ""A part of me totally rages at the world for its totally inadequate response to climate change,"" Ms Roberts said. ""Everybody's safety is at risk."" That anger is being now channelled into a legal challenge against the NSW Environment Protection Authority. Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action, of which Ms Roberts is a member, began the suit last week with the NSW Environmental Defenders Office ""to kick [the EPA] into action"", she said. EDO chief executive David Morris said the case, in the Land and Environment Court, would seek to force the EPA, which does not have a climate policy, to use its powers to keep communities safe from the increasingly severe impacts of a warming world. Mr Morris said the EPA was chosen as a test case among similar agencies nationally in part because of a section of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. That section requires the agency to “develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection”. ""It's an opportunity for the EPA to recognise they have a legal obligation to take action,"" he said. ""They should have a policy and a plan to address the greatest threat to the environment."" 'A part of me totally rages': Lisa Roberts, a horticulturist entrepreneur, is part of a legal challenge against the NSW Environment Protection Authority after bushfires hit her multi-million businesses hard. An EPA spokesman said the agency had received court documents from the EDO ""and is considering them"". A spokesman for NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean said it was ""inappropriate to comment"" on an ongoing legal matter. The Land and Environment Court has made significant climate-related decisions before, including in February last year when it found the final, so-called scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions produced by burning coal should be taken into account when considering the environmental impacts of new mines. Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action chairwoman Jo Dodds says she can't look at the environment without imagining how it will look when it is burnt. Bushfire Survivors chairwoman Jo Dodds, who is also a Bega Shire councillor, said the group's 30-odd members had endured fires from the 2003 blazes in Canberra, Black Saturday in Victoria in 2009 and the fires that devastated parts of her town in Tathra two years ago. Cr Dodds said the legal action was aimed at making the EPA ""live up to its remit"".

21,/environment/climate-change/kick-them-into-action-fire-group-takes-epa-to-court-over-climate-20200418-p54kzl.html,'Kick them into action': Fire group takes EPA to court over climate,"Lisa Roberts spent 25 years building a native plant business that was as sustainable as they come, with off-grid solar power and water harvesting, only to see it go up in flames in the recent bushfires. Her home and nursery in Wandella in southern NSW reduced to rubble, Ms Roberts fled to Canberra, powerless to act as fires threatened another venture in nearby Pialligo. Living in the smoke-choked capital also damaged her vocal cords, which have still not recovered. Lisa Roberts and her partner lost their home and nursery in Wandella in summer's bushfires, prompting her to lead a novel legal case against the NSW Environment Protection Authority.Credit:Lisa Roberts ""A part of me totally rages at the world for its totally inadequate response to climate change,"" Ms Roberts said. ""Everybody's safety is at risk."" That anger is being now channelled into a legal challenge against the NSW Environment Protection Authority. Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action, of which Ms Roberts is a member, began the suit last week with the NSW Environmental Defenders Office ""to kick [the EPA] into action"", she said. EDO chief executive David Morris said the case, in the Land and Environment Court, would seek to force the EPA, which does not have a climate policy, to use its powers to keep communities safe from the increasingly severe impacts of a warming world. Mr Morris said the EPA was chosen as a test case among similar agencies nationally in part because of a section of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. That section requires the agency to “develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection”. ""It's an opportunity for the EPA to recognise they have a legal obligation to take action,"" he said. ""They should have a policy and a plan to address the greatest threat to the environment."" 'A part of me totally rages': Lisa Roberts, a horticulturist entrepreneur, is part of a legal challenge against the NSW Environment Protection Authority after bushfires hit her multi-million businesses hard. An EPA spokesman said the agency had received court documents from the EDO ""and is considering them"". A spokesman for NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean said it was ""inappropriate to comment"" on an ongoing legal matter. The Land and Environment Court has made significant climate-related decisions before, including in February last year when it found the final, so-called scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions produced by burning coal should be taken into account when considering the environmental impacts of new mines. Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action chairwoman Jo Dodds says she can't look at the environment without imagining how it will look when it is burnt. Bushfire Survivors chairwoman Jo Dodds, who is also a Bega Shire councillor, said the group's 30-odd members had endured fires from the 2003 blazes in Canberra, Black Saturday in Victoria in 2009 and the fires that devastated parts of her town in Tathra two years ago. Cr Dodds said the legal action was aimed at making the EPA ""live up to its remit"". The agency ""needs to have adequate policies around climate change"", including setting limits on greenhouse emissions and enforcing them, she said. Cr Dodds said she had to evacuate to the Bega River in 2018 and watch on as aerial water bombers tried to save hers and other homes from being engulfed in flames.
