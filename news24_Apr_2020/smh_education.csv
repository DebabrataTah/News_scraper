The HSC  exams will go ahead in 2020, the NSW Education Standards Authority confirmed on Friday, with the timetable to be confirmed in mid-May and the results to be released in mid-December. But if public schools follow the goverment's staged return model for year 12 - one day a week for four weeks from May 11, then two days for another four - their HSC candidates will have 12 days of face-to-face teaching in term two, while private school students who go back full time will have 40 days. HSC examinations will go ahead in 2020.Credit:Marina Neil The president of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the discrepancy put the 2020 HSC at risk. ""The model introduces a profound inequity in preparation,"" he said. ""Under these unfair conditions, the HSC could not continue. It would appear that the Premier's office failed to consider these consequences when devising their plan."" Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Tuesday that all government students, including those in year 12, would be asked to attend school for one day a week from May 11, and that would slowly increase until term 3, when all students would attend full time. Private schools supported a return to school in principle but can make their own decisions on how to do it. Many are sending year 12 back first for full-time, face-to-face learning from mid-May. Those schools include Trinity Grammar, St Catherine's School, SCEGGs Darlinghurst and Catholic high schools such as Emmaus Catholic College. One source close to HSC planning said the differing amount of face-to-face teaching over term two raised a ""real issue about the credibility of the HSC. Students will put in for misadventure and their misadventure is that they attend a government school."" Students are upset. On an HSC discussion forum yesterday, one student urged her peers to write to Ms Berejiklian and complain. ""Well this isn't fair,"" wrote another. ""Not that I wanted to go to school but it gives private students an advantage."" Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the government's plan gave principals the flexibility to accommodate year 12 students in a way that best suited the school community. ""[NESA will] continue to work through the details of the HSC for 2020 to ensure equity for students in all systems,"" she said. Craig Petersen, the president of the Secondary Principals Council - which represents public school principals, said some educators were concerned this year's HSC ""would not be a level playing field"". But public school principals were already working to maximise class time for year 12, he said, while still adhering to government directions to bring back all students for one day a week. ""Some will be bringing [year 12] back to class,"" he said. ""Others will continue with the online learning environment. Principals will have the flexibility to do whatever they can. We are fairly happy with that."" Mr Petersen has asked the Department of Education to consider altering the second phase of the return-to-school plan - when students are due to return two days a week - to prioritise year 12. The Teachers' Federation is pushing for year 12 and kindergarten to return first, a model supported by the Catholic school sector, in which secondary schools are prioritising year 12. The federation said the one-day model would cause huge logistical challenges. Weeks of simmering tensions between the union and the government surfaced this week, when Ms Berejiklian accused the union of wanting students to do remote learning at home indefinitely - a claim rejected by Mr Gavrielatos. Meanwhile, NESA confirmed HSC exams would go ahead this year, and results would be released in mid-December as originally planned. NESA had previously confirmed that students would get their HSC in 2020 but had not clarified that the exams would proceed. Authorities can determine results on the basis of assessment marks or teacher estimates, as the United Kingdom is doing after cancelling its leaving exams. A meeting of the authority's COVID-19 response committee yesterday decided to proceed with the exams. A timetable will be released by May 15.

The new guidance confirms teachers and students will not need to stay more than 1.5 metres away from each other in the classroom, pushing back against union demands for continued online learning at home. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the 1.5 metre social distancing rules don't apply in classrooms.Credit:Shutterstock While state governments are at odds over when to bring all students back to school, the state and federal chief medical officers issued updated advice to assure parents the classrooms could be kept safe. NSW health officials are also preparing to release a report this weekend that has not found significant evidence that children are transmitting the virus in schools, even in cases where students were found to be infected. Prime Minister Scott Morrison emerged from a national cabinet meeting on Friday to urge teachers to return to work like supermarket workers, bus drivers and others who were working while meeting rules designed to prevent the spread of the virus. ""Their risk is not in the classroom – their risk is in the staff room,"" he said of the teachers. Replay   State figures show that infections among school-age children make up a very small proportion of COVID-19 cases across the country. People aged 19 and under accounted for 122 cases of the virus in NSW out of a state total of 2976, according to figures up to Thursday night. All but five of these have recovered. The same age group accounted for 58 cases in Victoria out of a state total of 1343 people as at Friday morning, with all but two recovered. One the active cases is a teenage boy and the other is a girl aged 4 and under. Of the 1026 cases in Queensland up to midday on Friday, only 48 were aged 19 or under. but the state government declined to say how many had recovered. There have been 17 cases in South Australia among those aged 19 and under, out of a state total of 438, and all have recovered. There are more than 1.2 million school students in NSW, more than 990,000 in Victoria and more than 830,000 in Queensland, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Mr Morrison said the updated advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee – made up of federal and state chief medical officers – did not require classrooms to meet the social distancing rules for other spaces. The usual rules are for people to stay 1.5 metres away from each other and for internal spaces to be limited to one person for every four square metres. ""They need to ensure they have social distancing happening in the lunch room and the staff room and at drop off and at pick up and their engagement with parents,"" he told Sky News on Friday after the national cabinet meeting. ""But retailers are doing the same thing right now. People are doing it in manufacturing plants, on construction sites, workers are doing it."" Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the risk of transmission in schools was low because COVID-19 was very different to influenza, which spread quickly among the young. ""Most children who have contracted the virus in Australia have contracted it in the family home,"" Professor Murphy said. Asked whether the low rates among children reflected a lack of testing in that age group, Professor Murphy rejected this concern and pointed to the imminent NSW study. ""We don't have evidence of significant infection in children, and, more importantly, we are not seeing evidence of significant transmission amongst children in schools,"" he said. ""New South Wales Health have just done a very large study looking at some infections that have occurred in the school setting and have tested a lot of children [and] have not found evidence that children are transmitting this virus in schools."" The report by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance for NSW Health is due to be released on Sunday. In another clash between federal and state governments on schools, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton accused Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of ""running scared"" of the Queensland Teachers' Union because she would not resume full classes. The union told members they should not allow too many children back to the classroom because it would be ""physically impossible"" to meet the social distancing rules, but the statement was made before the AHPPC confirmed the 1.5 metre rule did not apply.

It comes amid mounting concern about casual workforces across the state's universities, with Sydney University slashing 30 per cent of its arts courses and one-third of casuals at the University of NSW reporting they've lost work. Replay   ""This is not a one-off hit,"" WSU Vice-Chancellor Barney Glover told staff via video link on Thursday. ""The challenge is bigger in 2021 [and 2022] than it is in 2020."" The university has flagged a $90 million shortfall in 2020, which could grow to between $120 and $130 million in 2021 and 2022 as travel restrictions remain in place and anticipated growth fails to materialise. University of Wollongong vice-chancellor Paul Wellings on Thursday also revealed a shortfall of $90 million linked to COVID-19 restrictions, which he said would have ""compounding effects for subsequent years"". Wollongong executive leadership will take a 20 per cent pay cut for 12 months and freeze non-essential external recruitment. Professor Glover said WSU would compensate by increasing domestic student numbers and reducing expenditure, including by cutting its casual budget in semester two while courses were predominantly delivered online. Casual staff will be prioritised for work on new six-month online courses created by the federal government's higher education relief package, but Professor Glover said the scheme did not ""go far enough for the sector at the moment"".

Sydney University's arts and social science faculty has been told to cut its courses by almost a third next semester to reduce the cost of casual staff as revenue plummets due to COVID-19. Academics have been asked to target courses that were not essential to the progress of a degree, even if students had already enrolled in them.

Schools in the sector will also be able to reduce general staff member's pay and hours by up to 25 per cent as some grapple with sharp fee shortfalls caused by the virus. General staff at independent schools can be redeployed into other roles under the deal.Credit:Erin Jonasson The deal, agreed between independent school associations and the sector's union on Thursday, does not apply to teachers or schools that have negotiated enterprise agreements with their staff but will still cover hundreds of other private schools across the country. It paves the way for schools to reduce their wage bills without risking a stoush with their employees of the kind that befell Haileybury, a top Melbourne private school, when it tried to stand down some of its music teachers. The school abandoned its effort after the union went to the industrial tribunal. Michelle Green, the chief executive of Independent Schools Victoria, said the COVID-19 pandemic had forced schools to make a choice between cutting the hours of some staff or standing them down completely. ""This measure, supported by the IEU, aims to keep non-teaching school staff in their jobs during the current crisis,"" Ms Green said. ""The alternative might have been that these staff would be stood down without pay."" Most independent schools are unable to access the federal government's JobKeeper scheme, though Chris Watt, federal secretary of the Independent Education Union, said some had still suffered ""serious cash flow issues"", which had triggered the negotiations. Mr Watt said there had been no similar discussions about teachers, though he cautioned the economic impact of the virus was uncertain. ""Teachers should be fully engaged irrespective of whether kids are at school or remote learning,"" he said. Under the deal, schools will be allowed to direct their employees to work in areas outside their usual role, so long as they are qualified and it is safe for them to do so. That could see idle bus drivers directed to do maintenance and canteen staff to clean grounds. If a school wants to cut staff hours, it has to inform them in writing and tell the union. The Fair Work Commission will consider the deal on Sunday. Once it has been approved, the changes will stay in effect until August. Assistant Secretary of the union's NSW branch, Carol Matthews, said the measure would have little relevance in the state as most independent school employees were covered by enterprise agreements. The deal follows similar bargains struck between unions and employers in the hospitality, restaurant and administrative sectors.

Schools in the sector will also be able to reduce general staff member's pay and hours by up to 25 per cent as some grapple with sharp fee shortfalls caused by the virus. General staff at independent schools can be redeployed into other roles under the deal.Credit:Erin Jonasson The deal, agreed between independent school associations and the sector's union on Thursday, does not apply to teachers or schools that have negotiated enterprise agreements with their staff but will still cover hundreds of other private schools across the country. It paves the way for schools to reduce their wage bills without risking a stoush with their employees of the kind that befell Haileybury, a top Melbourne private school, when it tried to stand down some of its music teachers. The school abandoned its effort after the union went to the industrial tribunal. Michelle Green, the chief executive of Independent Schools Victoria, said the COVID-19 pandemic had forced schools to make a choice between cutting the hours of some staff or standing them down completely. ""This measure, supported by the IEU, aims to keep non-teaching school staff in their jobs during the current crisis,"" Ms Green said. ""The alternative might have been that these staff would be stood down without pay."" Most independent schools are unable to access the federal government's JobKeeper scheme, though Chris Watt, federal secretary of the Independent Education Union, said some had still suffered ""serious cash flow issues"", which had triggered the negotiations. Mr Watt said there had been no similar discussions about teachers, though he cautioned the economic impact of the virus was uncertain. ""Teachers should be fully engaged irrespective of whether kids are at school or remote learning,"" he said. Under the deal, schools will be allowed to direct their employees to work in areas outside their usual role, so long as they are qualified and it is safe for them to do so. That could see idle bus drivers directed to do maintenance and canteen staff to clean grounds. If a school wants to cut staff hours, it has to inform them in writing and tell the union. The Fair Work Commission will consider the deal on Sunday. Once it has been approved, the changes will stay in effect until August. Assistant Secretary of the union's NSW branch, Carol Matthews, said the measure would have little relevance in the state as most independent school employees were covered by enterprise agreements. The deal follows similar bargains struck between unions and employers in the hospitality, restaurant and administrative sectors.

It comes amid mounting concern about casual workforces across the state's universities. Western Sydney University has warned staff it will cut casual workloads next semester; Sydney University is slashing 30 per cent of its arts courses; and one-third of casuals at the University of NSW have reported losing work. But it has been unclear if universities would meet the threshold to access JobKeeper, as the federal government on Friday rejected La Trobe University's bid for the subsidy. Sydney University expects a $470 million hit to its bottom line as a result of COVID-19.Credit:Louise Kennerley In an email to staff on Friday, Sydney University vice-chancellor Michael Spence said the university could receive between $100 and $140 million in JobKeeper funding if the majority of eligible staff apply. ""This would be an incredible improvement on our financial situation and would help shape the scale of further savings measures currently being considered,"" he said. La Trobe's vice-chancellor John Dewar initially claimed the university had demonstrated at least 30 per cent reduction in turnover between March 2019 and 2020, and said JobKeeper would allow it to recover $50 million of its $150 million shortfall. But Mr Frydenberg issued a statement saying universities would have to include government funding in their turnover calculations, rejecting La Trobe's apparent rationale that government funding did not count as GST turnover, which is used to assess eligibility. ""Changes will clarify that the core Commonwealth government financial assistance provided to universities will be included in the JobKeeper turnover tests,"" a statement from Mr Frydenberg said. A spokeswoman for La Trobe said the university had acted in good faith and followed the published ATO guidelines. ""We are very disappointed that the application criteria have changed again. JobKeeper was set up to help protect jobs and by moving the goal posts a second time, this will cost jobs in universities,"" the spokeswoman said. Universities face the same requirements as businesses to qualify for JobKeeper. They must demonstrate a 30 per cent turnover decline if their revenue is under $1 billion and 50 per cent if it is above $1 billion. A University of Sydney spokeswoman said the university believed it met relevant criteria regardless of whether it calculated government funding. ""During one of the relevant periods of time, we calculated a revenue reduction of over 50 per cent in our GST turnover, whether or not government grants are included,"" she said. Sydney University expects a shortfall of $470 million this year, due in part to the loss of thousands of full fee-paying Chinese students. WSU vice-chancellor Barney Glover on Thursday told staff that there had been ""a great deal of speculation"" about JobKeeper in the higher education sector. ""Technically we are eligible to apply, but there are tests you have to pass ... The advice we received [is] no Australian university would be likely to pass the threshold,"" he said. At Sydney University, casual and fixed-term staff make up about 60 per cent of the workforce, according to the 2018 annual report. The university says fixed-term and long-term casual staff would be eligible for JobKeeper. Under the scheme, the government would subsidise the university $1500 a fortnight for each eligible staff member. A report compiled by the University of NSW Casuals Network showed that one in three casuals at the university had lost work this month, costing them an average of $626 a week, and 42 per cent were working unpaid hours.

The question over closing schools has been the ""messiest part"" of the state's coronavirus response.Credit:Andrew Quilty The NSW Teachers Federation has been highly critical of the government's one-day-a-week plan, saying it ""beggars belief"" and fails to comprehend the massive logistical challenges it would cause.

16,/national/nsw/why-we-ve-decided-on-a-managed-return-to-school-20200423-p54mhy.html,Why we've decided on a managed return to school,"For 800,000 children across NSW, school is such an important place. A safe space where they can learn, play and grow. Their home when not at home. The coronavirus pandemic has taken away so much from so many people, but one thing we won’t let it take from our students is their experience at school. Children are missing the connection with teachers and fellow students. Credit:Quentin Jones When our schools moved to distance learning there were up to 200 new COVID-19 cases in NSW being reported daily. Today, there are five. So far, students in NSW have lost three weeks of face-to-face school. This week we announced a plan to limit that loss to a total of five weeks. By week three of term two, every NSW government school student will be in the classroom with a teacher at least once a week. As always in education, there is no shortage of opinions. Some say this is too soon, others that it is not enough. Or that only Year 12 should return. Or it is too complicated. There may be truth in all these criticisms – or there may be none. There is no perfect answer except that school is the best place for our students to be. And that truth has been our driving force in formulating this plan. The reality is that we need a way back into the classroom. It needs to leave no student behind and it needs to do so in a way that builds confidence for teachers and parents that schools are a safe place for everyone. Year 12 is always a big year for students, and it’s even more challenging in 2020. But these students are also the most capable of taking up the mantle to study themselves. We can support them effectively, see them in classes, but they are not our only priority. To allow only Year 12 students to return first, as some have suggested, leaves a significant portion of our school students at risk of not seeing their teachers for an entire term or potentially more. Many of these students are also in a crucial time at school, where they develop the formative skills needed to achieve when it is their turn for the HSC. It is a suggestion from those who have forgotten that we must value the education of every child equally. In some cases, it is people who shroud their reluctance to have any child attend school while there is a pandemic behind clever rhetoric. Every year at school is a crucial year. Every child is important. And we recognise the importance of the relationship between teacher and student. That’s why we are getting every student back to school for at least a day every week. We want to check their progress, their engagement with learning and their wellbeing. We want to make sure none are lost to learning. We want to ensure none lose their connection with school or their bonds with each other. Our schools have shown great agility and ingenuity so far. This week principals and staff have received a great deal of information, including guidelines on how this plan can work in their local context. They have the autonomy to tailor this to their local community, because they are best placed for that job. Principals know their students and their families, and we trust them implicitly. Already we have seen resilience and excitement from our school teachers to create a way to gradually open the doors of our schools. In between the naysayers in the media and online commentary, there are the quiet voices of determination and ingenuity. Parents, teachers, students, principals and support staff who are rising to the challenge. One of COVID-19’s malicious calling cards is the uncertainty the virus creates in our community. As parents, it gnaws away at us: the uncertainty of employment or the challenge of working from home, the concerns about our own family’s health, the lack of social connections and the added responsibility of monitoring our children’s education. For our students, the virus breeds anxiety, whether in larger doses for those preparing for the HSC, or for our youngest learners who just want to see their friends in the playground.

17,/national/nsw/why-we-ve-decided-on-a-managed-return-to-school-20200423-p54mhy.html,Why we've decided on a managed return to school,"For 800,000 children across NSW, school is such an important place. A safe space where they can learn, play and grow. Their home when not at home. The coronavirus pandemic has taken away so much from so many people, but one thing we won’t let it take from our students is their experience at school. Children are missing the connection with teachers and fellow students. Credit:Quentin Jones When our schools moved to distance learning there were up to 200 new COVID-19 cases in NSW being reported daily. Today, there are five. So far, students in NSW have lost three weeks of face-to-face school. This week we announced a plan to limit that loss to a total of five weeks. By week three of term two, every NSW government school student will be in the classroom with a teacher at least once a week. As always in education, there is no shortage of opinions. Some say this is too soon, others that it is not enough. Or that only Year 12 should return. Or it is too complicated. There may be truth in all these criticisms – or there may be none. There is no perfect answer except that school is the best place for our students to be. And that truth has been our driving force in formulating this plan. The reality is that we need a way back into the classroom. It needs to leave no student behind and it needs to do so in a way that builds confidence for teachers and parents that schools are a safe place for everyone. Year 12 is always a big year for students, and it’s even more challenging in 2020. But these students are also the most capable of taking up the mantle to study themselves. We can support them effectively, see them in classes, but they are not our only priority. To allow only Year 12 students to return first, as some have suggested, leaves a significant portion of our school students at risk of not seeing their teachers for an entire term or potentially more. Many of these students are also in a crucial time at school, where they develop the formative skills needed to achieve when it is their turn for the HSC. It is a suggestion from those who have forgotten that we must value the education of every child equally. In some cases, it is people who shroud their reluctance to have any child attend school while there is a pandemic behind clever rhetoric. Every year at school is a crucial year. Every child is important. And we recognise the importance of the relationship between teacher and student. That’s why we are getting every student back to school for at least a day every week. We want to check their progress, their engagement with learning and their wellbeing. We want to make sure none are lost to learning. We want to ensure none lose their connection with school or their bonds with each other. Our schools have shown great agility and ingenuity so far. This week principals and staff have received a great deal of information, including guidelines on how this plan can work in their local context. They have the autonomy to tailor this to their local community, because they are best placed for that job. Principals know their students and their families, and we trust them implicitly. Already we have seen resilience and excitement from our school teachers to create a way to gradually open the doors of our schools. In between the naysayers in the media and online commentary, there are the quiet voices of determination and ingenuity. Parents, teachers, students, principals and support staff who are rising to the challenge. One of COVID-19’s malicious calling cards is the uncertainty the virus creates in our community. As parents, it gnaws away at us: the uncertainty of employment or the challenge of working from home, the concerns about our own family’s health, the lack of social connections and the added responsibility of monitoring our children’s education. For our students, the virus breeds anxiety, whether in larger doses for those preparing for the HSC, or for our youngest learners who just want to see their friends in the playground. With a tremendous effort from everyone in our school communities, our schools will once more be alive with laughter and learning as students return during Term 2. Of that, we can be certain.

Preschools should be run like schools as part of a birth-to-year-12 education system, ideally with childcare centres built within or next door to primary schools, the ex-Labor premier said. Former SA Labor premier Jay Weatherill in Perth, where he is CEO of Thrive by Five.Credit:Karina Vakil He argued that for-profit operators had no place in the Australian childcare sector, which was publicly funded with $7.7 billion in 2018-19 and attended by 1.65 million children. ""It is always going to be hard to create a coherent and universal system if you’ve got private for-profit agencies sitting in the middle of it,"" Mr Weatherill said. The Australian early learning sector is funded through a mix of Commonwealth subsidy and parents’ fees. The Morrison government was forced to rescue the sector from a feared collapse this month after many parents withdrew their children in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Weatherill said the pandemic had exposed the underlying poor state of the sector and said it would be untenable to return to the status quo once the crisis has passed. ""What’s been revealed through the COVID-19 crisis is essentially a crisis in childcare,"" he said. ""We’ve had the near collapse of the system, you’ve got a number of childcare centres that are still going to be struggling even with the intervention of the Commonwealth, because the revenues haven’t returned to where they were."" The former Labor premier spoke exclusively to The Age and Sydney Morning Herald in his first interview since taking up a new role as chief executive of Thrive by Five, part of mining magnate Andrew Forrest and wife Nicola Forrest's philanthropic Minderoo Foundation. His family has relocated to Perth for the position. Mr Weatherill described the role as ""a dream job"" for someone who spent much of his political career in ministerial portfolios concerned with children’s welfare and education. But he admitted to being uncertain about leaving the state he led between 2011 and 2018, expecting his daughters, aged 13 and 15, would be against the move. ""I thought this wasn’t going to happen because I wouldn’t do that to them if they were opposed to it but … they were remarkably up for the adventure,"" he said. Mr Weatherill said Australia’s early learning standards were below world’s best practice because childcare is viewed chiefly as a means to help parents work, not as the critical foundation period of education. He said Australia risked having a ""COVID generation"" of children who missed a critical chunk of their education if childcare centres were left to fail. ""Most of the public discourse about childcare has been about its effect on people getting back to work; almost no discussion has been focused on what the child is missing out on in terms of the basic building blocks for their learning, because it’s just not widely understood how profoundly important the brain development of a child is in those first five years,"" he said. On April 2 the Morrison government injected $1.3 billion into the childcare sector over three months, announcing childcare would be free for more than a  million families. Samantha Page, chief executive of Early Childhood Australia, said the peak body for the early learning sector had advocated for several years for free or very low-cost childhood education. ""That could be delivered by a mix of providers, but we don’t think it should be predicated on parental workforce participation or income level or capacity to pay,"" Ms Page said. Like school education, it should be seen as a worthwhile public investment, she said. But Ms Page warned any move to take full public ownership of early education would come at a huge cost to taxpayers, given governments had relied on private interests to help meet growing demand for childcare for generations. ""Successive governments of Labor and Liberal flavour have relied on the private sector to fund the infrastructure required to meet demand,"" Ms Page said. Dan Tehan, the federal Education Minister, said states and territories were responsible for regulating the quality and safety of childcare services. ""The federal government pays the childcare subsidy to eligible services on behalf of parents and carers,"" Mr Tehan said. ""The subsidy is designed to assist parents with the cost of childcare while they’re working, training, studying or volunteering."" But Mr Weatherill said too many centres failed to meet quality standards. According to the latest national quality framework snapshot, published in December, 80 per cent of Australian childcare centres meet the national standard for providing care and education. It is the best result the sector has achieved since monitoring began in 2012. Adam Carey is Education Editor.

In many ways, the announcement and limited detail that has accompanied it has raised more questions than it answered, and will cause additional concern and confusion for educators, students and parents alike. It will be both welcomed and criticised.What can we expect? What will school look like on May 11? This is almost impossible to answer just yet. School will look very different across the 3000 schools across NSW. It will look different in schools in adjacent suburbs. It will certainly look different between primary and secondary settings. Replay   Principals are already consulting with their leadership teams to determine what will work best in their specific context. This will be affected by a range of factors: the age of the students and the age of the staff; the incidence (or not) of COVID-19 in their local community; the level of access to technology; the size of the school; the numbers of families with children in different years; the nature of the school site, including the design and size of the classrooms … the list goes on. Neither the Premier nor the Minister for Education have prescribed exactly what the return should look like, and nor should they. This is a prime example of where decisions need to be made at a local level, informed by advice from the Department of Health, and from the Department of Education, certainly, but driven by the needs of the students, staff and families in each community. The principal and teachers know their school and students best and we can have confidence that they will make the best decisions for their situation. After all, we should not forget their phenomenal achievements in adapting to delivering schooling to home literally overnight only a month ago. Some colleagues I have spoken to will most likely run their usual timetable for those students in attendance. Given that some parents will choose to continue to keep their children at home and that some at-risk staff will continue to work from home, others may decide to reduce the number of periods during the day and adopt a broader approach to what the school day looks like. For some it will be a chance to collect work that was completed over the last week or so, check that key concepts have been understood (and clarify those that weren’t) before giving the next week’s ""package"". This will be particularly important for those students who may not have access to technology at home or whose parents are unable to effectively support their learning. It will also be important to re-think the structure of the day because teachers cannot simultaneously teach some of their class in this room, some in the room next door (where classes are divided to conform to social distancing restrictions) and some who are still at home. Will this be easy? No. Just like flipping our pedagogy from face-to-face to online and providing quality education in the midst of a pandemic was not easy, this will continue to be a huge challenge. Are we up to it? Most definitely. Because students are at the centre of what we do every day. Because we know the capabilities of our teachers. Because we are passionate about the young people whose lives we are privileged to influence. Because we are professionals. But most of all, because every principal and every teacher deals with the incredibly complex every day. That is what we do. The difference is that now the complexity of the work we do is being witnessed, experienced and appreciated not only by parents but the broader community, and teachers are getting the respect and recognition that they deserve.

It will be both welcomed and criticised.What can we expect? What will school look like on May 11? This is almost impossible to answer just yet. School will look very different across the 3000 schools across NSW. It will look different in schools in adjacent suburbs. It will certainly look different between primary and secondary settings. Replay   Principals are already consulting with their leadership teams to determine what will work best in their specific context. This will be affected by a range of factors: the age of the students and the age of the staff; the incidence (or not) of COVID-19 in their local community; the level of access to technology; the size of the school; the numbers of families with children in different years; the nature of the school site, including the design and size of the classrooms … the list goes on. Neither the Premier nor the Minister for Education have prescribed exactly what the return should look like, and nor should they. This is a prime example of where decisions need to be made at a local level, informed by advice from the Department of Health, and from the Department of Education, certainly, but driven by the needs of the students, staff and families in each community. The principal and teachers know their school and students best and we can have confidence that they will make the best decisions for their situation. After all, we should not forget their phenomenal achievements in adapting to delivering schooling to home literally overnight only a month ago. Some colleagues I have spoken to will most likely run their usual timetable for those students in attendance. Given that some parents will choose to continue to keep their children at home and that some at-risk staff will continue to work from home, others may decide to reduce the number of periods during the day and adopt a broader approach to what the school day looks like. For some it will be a chance to collect work that was completed over the last week or so, check that key concepts have been understood (and clarify those that weren’t) before giving the next week’s ""package"". This will be particularly important for those students who may not have access to technology at home or whose parents are unable to effectively support their learning. It will also be important to re-think the structure of the day because teachers cannot simultaneously teach some of their class in this room, some in the room next door (where classes are divided to conform to social distancing restrictions) and some who are still at home. Will this be easy? No. Just like flipping our pedagogy from face-to-face to online and providing quality education in the midst of a pandemic was not easy, this will continue to be a huge challenge. Are we up to it? Most definitely. Because students are at the centre of what we do every day. Because we know the capabilities of our teachers. Because we are passionate about the young people whose lives we are privileged to influence. Because we are professionals. But most of all, because every principal and every teacher deals with the incredibly complex every day. That is what we do. The difference is that now the complexity of the work we do is being witnessed, experienced and appreciated not only by parents but the broader community, and teachers are getting the respect and recognition that they deserve.

Professor Raina MacIntyre.Credit:Peter Braig Professor MacIntyre, who is head of the Biosecurity Research Program at the institute, spoke of the ""myth of herd immunity"" – exposing a population to the virus for the purposes of building up natural immunity and sacrificing the vulnerable. ""It does have a connotation of eugenics,"" she said. ""What you will see is a large increase in cases for little gain because probably by the time you get to about 20 to 30 per cent of the population impacted, you'll start putting the brakes on and having more lockdowns because the health system will be too severely impacted. ""We'll have these cycling epidemics, large proportions of absenteeism from work and see the full spectrum of disease – as has been seen in the US, the UK, Europe and China – which is that you are seeing deaths in children, infants and young people,"" she said. ""You'll start to see healthcare workers dying as they are dying in those countries ... that will impact your capacity to treat other conditions. If half your workforce is off sick or in quarantine because you're having a massive outbreak in your hospital, you may not be able to get treatment if you turn up with your myocardial infarction,"" she said. Herd immunity is not a strategy the Australian government is pursuing. Instead all states and territories are on a containment or elimination trajectory. But Professor McIntyre's comments follow days of public debate about whether the economic hardships caused by Australia's current restrictions, implemented to protect the elderly and vulnerable, impact too heavily on the young and healthy. Professor of Infectious Diseases at Australian National University Peter Collignon said herd immunity in Sweden did not seem to be working, however he did think students should be returning to schools in Australia. ""If this were influenza I'd be closing schools but all the data seems to suggest this infection is very uncommon in the under 15 age group, schools are probably one of the safest workplaces you can go,"" he said.

Attendance would then be lifted to two days, possibly in mid-June. If all goes well, students would return full-time when term three begins in July, albeit with restrictions, such as a ban on excursions and inter-school sports. Public schools must follow the government's model, but can make their own decisions on how to roster their students. They have been asked to keep sibling groups together. Some principals may choose alphabetical order, or sporting houses, or stage groups.

""Parents are well and truly over the distance learning process and are really looking forward to having kids go back to school,"" he said. The government chose to involve all year groups in a staged return because every child deserved the chance to go to school and have face-to-face contact with teachers.

As health experts say there is greater danger of adult to adult than child to adult transmission, parents will be asked to avoid congregating at pick up and drop off. ""We will be keeping a close eye on the data ... we will be able to monitor how we are going across the board,"" said Ms Berejiklian. ""We will see after a couple of weeks how the one day a week is going, if it is going well we'll upscale, if it's not we'll stay at one day. Our systems are quite sophisticated in NSW in terms of following what the virus is doing. ""This does not mean that no teacher or student will get the virus. The safest thing to do at this stage in terms of restrictions is restoring children in a school setting, and we've taken on board that advice."" Forehead thermometers would be available but health experts advised that they be treated with caution, Ms Berejiklian said. ""It doesn't mean you have COVID and it doesn't mean you don't,"" she said. NSW Chief Medical Officer Kerry Chant said children and teachers across the state would be offered testing if they had symptoms. NSW Health had studied the spread of COVID-19 in schools, and would release its report later this week. ""In summary, it shows that children - while they are getting infected - are not the contributors to passing on that infection that we do know children are with other infectious diseases,"" she said. ""We know children do spread flu. We know children do spread other respiratory viruses. We are not seeing that same pattern in relation to children in COVID-19. ""However we are aware that interaction between adults, and the broader community [spreads the virus], so we want to take every opportunity to minimise the parent connection.""

If the one-day-a-week plan goes well, the next step - at an unspecified time - would be to increase attendance to two days per week, and then ramping up attendance in stages. Attendance could also be rolled back if transmission increases. There would likely be flexibility for individual principals, as there are vast differences between the state's 2200 public schools.

The strategy may also differ between areas with no COVID-19 cases, and areas that have been identified as hotspots. Some non-government school principals have said a roster system would not work, and are proposing different solutions for their own schools, such as reintroducing HSC students and kindergarten first, then adding extra students after a few weeks.

Universal monitoring of preschoolers' health and educational development would help early childhood educators detect the warning signs and intervene before children start primary school, the study report argues. Analysis of more than 5400 five-year-olds found a range of influences that are likely to set a child back in the early stages of education.Credit:iStock The research found 22 per cent of Australian children are developmentally vulnerable at age five. Analysis of more than 5400 Tasmanian five-year-olds found a range of influences are likely to set a child back in the early stages of education. Some risk factors stemmed from birth: low birth weight, premature birth, smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy all increased the chance of a child being developmentally vulnerable, the study found. The main carer’s highest education level and level of socioeconomic disadvantage were also factors. The study found that children who fit into more than one of these categories had the highest risk of being developmentally delayed: for example, 41 per cent of children in the study with a birth risk, health behaviour risk and a demographic risk were assessed as vulnerable. But rates of developmental vulnerability were also significant among children in ""low-risk"" categories: 16 per cent, or 550 low-risk children in the study, were vulnerable. The findings, by a group of six researchers in early childhood education at the Telethon Kids Institute, were published by the British Medical Journal on Tuesday. The report’s authors argued the findings indicated there was a need for increased investment in the monitoring of early childhood development, both in high-risk and low-risk groups. ""Given that more than one-fifth of Australian children are identified as developmentally vulnerable in their first year of full-time school, further investment in regular developmental monitoring across the first four years of life may be an important strategy for identifying and responding to developmental concerns before children start full-time school,"" the report said. The authors said children's developmental vulnerability would be more widely detected in a society with universal access to early childhood education and healthcare. ""The capacity for universal early childhood services to engage with children and families regularly from pregnancy to the start of full-time school is critical to reducing developmental vulnerability in all population groups,"" the report said. Kay Margetts, an associate professor in early childhood studies at the University of Melbourne, said it was concerning that more than 20 per cent of five-year old children were already at increased risk of falling behind when they began school. Professor Margetts said it was crucial for teachers of young children to tailor their lessons according to each child’s level of understanding, but said teachers also lacked the resources to help all students overcome educational disadvantage. ""Teachers are aware of socioeconomic and environmental factors that can make it difficult for children, but I don’t know that we actually have enough resources in our education system to support the children and the families,"" Professor Margetts said. ""If you look at home-schooling at the moment, where is the support parents are getting in order to support their children? ""How are the vulnerable children being supported?

As the impacts of the coronavirus are felt and thousands of jobs are threatened, the message is re-iterated in another way – “universities, greedy for revenues from foreign students, have unwisely exposed themselves to risk, now they are getting what they deserve”. Increasing levels of foreign students have helped universities fund research programs.Credit:Ryan Stuart  I recall even when at UNSW we were introducing a new and more flexible academic calendar for our students, one student said to me “this is just a trick designed to make the owners of the university even richer”. But the university doesn’t have any ""owners"". We are a not-for-profit institution, a registered charity, a public institution that serves the community. The revenues we raise are invested back into our operations (teaching and research) or put into infrastructure (buildings and IT systems). Profits do not go to shareholders, nor do they go to buying private jets for the directors. Universities are not “all about money” but we need money to provide world-class teaching and research. How did it come to this? As the education industry – and yes, it is now seen as Australia’s third largest export industry – has grown in size and become more competitive, research prowess quickly emerged as the differentiator. Once upon a time, universities were like local hospitals – they served the local population and looked after the health of the mind. Each country had hospitals in the larger towns. There was no real competition or league tables between hospitals because if you had a broken arm, it didn’t really make sense to seek out the top hospital in the world. If you had a very unusual or intractable disease you might travel to a hospital that specialised in that ailment, but in general your local hospital was fine – as long as it was of functional world standard. Universities were the same. Most students would travel to a local university, while only a few would go abroad to study special degrees, like French art or a doctorate. In general, universities were part of their communities, served those communities, and were respected by them. Things worked so well that more and more students went to university. Governments helped fund this but ultimately the costs grew and grew, and governments and taxpayers suggested that universities generate their own funding. Philanthropy and industry made important contributions but seldom provided a steady flow of reliable funding. Instead, Australian universities offered education to international students, who paid fees for what was on offer. In the 1990s more than 80 per cent of university funding came directly from the commonwealth, but in recent years base funding has moved to around 30 per cent. Universities were asked to generate their own revenues in the international marketplace and they did. Research became the distinguishing factor. Research can be measured and suddenly every university wanted to be like Harvard. Universities used international student fees to support their research and build institutional prestige. International students chose universities with more prestige. An upward spiral. And Australia built a first-rate university sector that allowed us to compete in the Asian century. As things evolved Australian universities repeatedly pointed out that it was risky to rely on international student fees to fund the costs of research. It was noted that the government funded research projects, via grants, but universities carried the infrastructure costs, which were about the same in dollar terms. So, the Cutler Review in 2007 recommended that Australia follow what was done in other countries and fund the ""full costs of research"" – the labs as well as the projects. The government agreed, but subsequent governments wound back the support to divert funding elsewhere, either to schools, to budget repair or tax relief. Universities, were never ""all about money"" but were understandably intent on attracting student fees to remain sustainable and internationally reputable. Didn’t everyone want our country to have some universities in the top 100 – Australia is in the top 100 in so many human endeavours and in virtually every sport. Again and again universities made the case for sustainable funding for research support and buildings but the first was cut and the building fund, the Higher Education Endowment Fund, became the Education Infrastructure Fund and was used up as the government had other important priorities, like the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This was an important scheme and it was prioritised because by this stage everyone expected that universities could survive and prosper on international student fees – provided nothing went wrong. Late last year rising international tensions suggested things were going wrong. The strong relationship between Australia and China remained but tensions were growing. Then there was the coronavirus outbreak and suddenly the music stopped. The answer is to sit down and work on whether Australia wants an internationally competitive university system that delivers in teaching and in research for our people, and does things like training health care workers and developing a vaccine for the coronavirus.

The government last week guaranteed $18 billion in funding for universities' domestic education in 2020 but the sector has warned the money does not address the implosion of international education caused by the COVID-19 crisis, which could cost them around $5 billion over the next six months and up to $19 billion over three years. Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek has accused the government of abandoning universities to a ""catastrophic"" situation.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The government is also facing scepticism about newly-announced online short courses, designed for up to 20,000 Australians to re-skill during the period of social distancing and economic slowdown. Universities are concerned there is little financial incentive to provide the cut-price qualifications. Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek has now hit out at the rescue package, saying the government was abandoning a sector that supports 260,000 jobs. ""Education, including universities, is Australia’s third biggest export, behind only iron ore and coal. If any other industry this size was facing such a catastrophic fall in revenue the government would, quite rightly, be in crisis talks,"" she told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. ""Despite the minister’s claims, it’s clear that the government’s announced proposals will provide no serious help for universities to survive this crisis – to be frank, it’s a fraud."" Modelling released last week projected a revenue blow for universities of $10 billion to $19 billion between 2020 and 2023, depending on border restrictions. The overall blow to the economy from lower international student numbers was projected at $30 billion to $60 billion over the three-year period. Ms Plibersek warned of ""job losses on an industrial scale"" and said ""every Australian would feel the loss"" but the worst was preventable if the government acted now.  Education Minister Dan Tehan said the government was continuing to work with the higher education sector to minimise the financial impact of COVID-19. ""We are aware that, like the rest of the Australian and global community, the university sector is not immune from the financial impact of the virus and that it covers a breadth of people within its communities including professional staff, academics, casual staff, domestic students, and international students,"" he said. Mr Tehan encouraged universities to seek loans from banks and state and territory governments and noted they could access the JobKeeper wage subsidy when their revenue declines met the eligibility thresholds – 30 per cent for organisations with turnover under $1 billion and 50 per cent if it is over $1 billion. Ms Plibersek criticised the government for excluding universities from more generous eligibility requirements for other registered charities, which must demonstrate a revenue decline of only 15 per cent. She said universities would not get any additional funding for the discounted online courses so universities would be ""expected to do more with less"". She also questioned whether they would give people a recognised qualification or help them get a job. Australian National University higher education researcher Andrew Norton said the student contributions for the short courses were less than they normally would get which meant they were not financially appealing for universities. He also questioned whether they were worthwhile qualifications or practical to implement.  Professor Norton said the funding guarantee announced by the government would be valuable for universities whose domestic enrolments were suffering but not for those whose numbers were holding up. ""The real revenue loss in internationals is not being compensated for in any way. That's not to say it should be compensated for – I don't think it should be. But I think there are grounds for looking at protecting worthwhile things that could be lost, like research projects that are midway through and things like that,"" he said. ""Universities should not be exempt from what everyone else is feeling but there are ways of minimising waste and loss in this contraction."" Mr Tehan has previously said the guaranteed funding for domestic education was universities' ""number one priority"" during negotiations and indicated the package would be the extent of the immediate support for the sector.

""We are aware that, like the rest of the Australian and global community, the university sector is not immune from the financial impact of the virus and that it covers a breadth of people within its communities including professional staff, academics, casual staff, domestic students, and international students,"" he said. Mr Tehan encouraged universities to seek loans from banks and state and territory governments and noted they could access the JobKeeper wage subsidy when their revenue declines met the eligibility thresholds – 30 per cent for organisations with turnover under $1 billion and 50 per cent if it is over $1 billion. Ms Plibersek criticised the government for excluding universities from more generous eligibility requirements for other registered charities, which must demonstrate a revenue decline of only 15 per cent. She said universities would not get any additional funding for the discounted online courses so universities would be ""expected to do more with less"". She also questioned whether they would give people a recognised qualification or help them get a job. Australian National University higher education researcher Andrew Norton said the student contributions for the short courses were less than they normally would get which meant they were not financially appealing for universities. He also questioned whether they were worthwhile qualifications or practical to implement.  Professor Norton said the funding guarantee announced by the government would be valuable for universities whose domestic enrolments were suffering but not for those whose numbers were holding up. ""The real revenue loss in internationals is not being compensated for in any way. That's not to say it should be compensated for – I don't think it should be. But I think there are grounds for looking at protecting worthwhile things that could be lost, like research projects that are midway through and things like that,"" he said. ""Universities should not be exempt from what everyone else is feeling but there are ways of minimising waste and loss in this contraction."" Mr Tehan has previously said the guaranteed funding for domestic education was universities' ""number one priority"" during negotiations and indicated the package would be the extent of the immediate support for the sector.

The NSW Department of Education data shows there were 1252 suspensions of 626 kindy kids in 2018 – an average of two each – while over the four years to 2019, about 70 per cent of kindy suspensions involved students with a disability. Across all primary school stages over the same period, an average of 73 per cent of suspensions involved students with disabilities. Within the general population of NSW public schools, 20 per cent of students are registered as having a disability. Disability advocacy groups say young kids are being sent home for behaviour they cannot control.Credit:Gabriele Charotte The group with the most total suspensions in primary school was stage 3 (years 5 and 6), with an annual average of 8418 in the four years to 2019, according to the figures provided by the department to NSW parliamentary budget estimates hearings. In high school, the most affected group was stage 4 – years 7 and 8 – with an annual average of 24,169 suspensions in the same period. But at secondary school, the proportion of suspensions involving students with a disability was lower. In stage five (years 9 and 10), it was about 48 per cent, and in stage six (years 11 and 12) it was around 36 per cent. Disability advocacy groups say young kids are being sent home for behaviour they cannot control, but teacher groups say they are being faced with increasingly extreme behaviour that is putting staff and other students at risk. Experts say behaviour issues are intensifying because students that would once have been in so-called support units are now in mainstream classrooms, but schools have not updated their classroom management strategies or their teacher training. The NSW Department of Education has said it was concerned about the high number of suspensions among students with a disability, and launched a review of its discipline strategy and suspension policy a year ago. Louise Kuchel, a spokeswoman for Parents for ADHD Advocacy Australia, said the review seemed to be making little progress, even before the COVID-19 outbreak. ""These issues were present long before the global COVID pandemic, and they will return in spades when school returns,"" she said. ""Children with disabilities like ADHD suffer in NSW schools and now the department's own statistics even report that."" A department spokeswoman said, ""it is expected that further information on the policy and strategy will be available in the middle of 2020"". David Roy, a disability advocate and education academic at Newcastle University, called for an independent rather than internal inquiry. ""Suspending children with a disability at these numbers suggests that the suspension is because of the disability rather than other factors,"" he said. State opposition education spokeswoman Prue Car said the government had been slow to act on a 2017 ombudsman's inquiry into the issue. ""The government has been too slow to act on the recommendations of the ombudsman's inquiry, and parents of these children have every right to ask why this is the case,"" she said. The NSW Department of Education spokeswoman said the shared goal of new behaviour and disability strategies was to help teachers support students with additional needs. An independent evidence review was being conducted by the Telethon Kids Institute, and the new strategy would include resources for teachers and training for specialist education staff. Before suspensions were imposed, reasonable adjustments had to be provided to support students with a disability, in accordance with discrimination acts, she said.

Even during COVID-19, some students are safer at school than home, and it is a school's duty to protect them. More than one million NSW students were learning at home with parental supervision. As the number of new COVID infections fall, parents will do the risk assessment and start sending their kids to school more readily, and schools need to be prepared for how they will protect staff and students. The government needs a clear strategy to ensure we are not faced with close to 100 per cent attendance before processes have been put in place to protect staff and students. Schools need to think creatively about how to get kids back at school, and every school will be different and should have the autonomy to come up with their own plan. One potential solution is to divide class groups so they are at school part-time and there is the ability to socially distance. Having students at school twice a week and learning at home the other days would be a huge protective factor for student wellbeing, allow parents to work more, and still keep teachers safe and socially distant. It would be a lot of work for the teachers to manage, however. Other suggestions have been to stagger entry across year groups, prioritising the youngest and oldest students. Learning spaces need to be considered to allow for social distancing, and if it is not possible, then other solutions need to be made. Attending school may mean that students have to practise more extreme social distancing when they're not attending, even though data continues to show kids and teenagers account for only about 10 per cent of the spread of COVID-19. The bigger issue is about protecting staff. Teachers should not feel guilty for wanting to protect themselves and their loved ones.

He said calls from families in strife have increased in the lockdown, where parents are not coping with children who have behavioral issues. But he has also heard positive stories about a resurgence in creative play. ""If you put kids in an empty space, in terms of routine and lack of structure, they will start to create their own worlds like finding a rock and pretending it is something else,"" he said.

Universities could compete for students through the quality of their in-house tutorials and guidance.Credit:Louise Kennerley Educational face-to-face contact has been disrupted by hastily arranged ""distance"" teaching. As we battle COVID-19, we should also plan a more efficient ""post-war"" use of scarce educational resources: the ""creative destruction"" and rebuilding of our tertiary education system. After the Great Fire (1666), Robert Hooke was surveyor to the City of London; and from the Robert Hooke building in Milton Keynes (no relation to either economist), the Open University (which began enrolling students in 1971) has become Britain’s largest university for undergraduate education. The Open University has frequently been rated the top university in England and Wales for student satisfaction. In most subjects, there are five components of teaching: enrolment (and guidance), textbooks (and other material), lectures, tutorials, and assessment. Lectures, tutorial discussions and videos can be consumed electronically, the marginal cost of which is zero (to the producer). And many textbooks can now be downloaded for the cost of printing. Lectures (and examinations) can be provided at no cost to students. Professional bodies of economists (the American Economic Association, the Economic Society of Australia) could produce lectures for virtually all undergraduate and post-graduate courses (Paul Krugman on international trade, Paul Romer on long-run macroeconomic analysis, Richard Thaler on behavioural economics). In the United States, postgraduate scholarship holders are often obliged to tutor two or three courses (and do the marking). This allows them to sample academic life and allows their referees to write job recommendations that reflect their success (or lack thereof). Universities could compete for students through the quality of their in-house tutorials and guidance. (Innovative in-house teaching can always be preferred over, or provided in addition to, lectures by Nobel laureates.) As Australia’s population increases, the geographical footprint of our universities could shrink while competing on the international stage for customers. By ""producing"" teaching more efficiently, resources can also be released to fund international best-practice research. Universities are the Cathedrals of the Modern Age but they are no longer sacred cows. The Dawkins revolution of the 1980s was, in some aspects, not well thought out: it turned competent trainers of nurses and teachers (colleges of advanced education) into low-quality ""export sector"" universities. And now, the chickens have come home to roost – or rather, billions of dollars of export revenue will be lost as Chinese students stay home. Semi-privatised universities have responded to incentives and have massively expanded degrees that are cheap to provide and from which comes a supply of graduates that vastly exceeds demand. Law degrees may train the mind but students and parents should be provided with reliable information about the probability of landing specific jobs. While such degrees are privately profitable for universities, it is socially wasteful for students to have to start again after graduating. Other mismatches can be minimised by having lectures freely available for students to sample before they commit. In 1917, future French prime minister Georges Clemenceau snapped: ""War is too important to be left to the generals."" Human capital formation – the key to increased productivity – is too important to be left to the poorly conceived private incentives we currently provide to our universities.

Lectures (and examinations) can be provided at no cost to students. Professional bodies of economists (the American Economic Association, the Economic Society of Australia) could produce lectures for virtually all undergraduate and post-graduate courses (Paul Krugman on international trade, Paul Romer on long-run macroeconomic analysis, Richard Thaler on behavioural economics). In the United States, postgraduate scholarship holders are often obliged to tutor two or three courses (and do the marking). This allows them to sample academic life and allows their referees to write job recommendations that reflect their success (or lack thereof). Universities could compete for students through the quality of their in-house tutorials and guidance. (Innovative in-house teaching can always be preferred over, or provided in addition to, lectures by Nobel laureates.) As Australia’s population increases, the geographical footprint of our universities could shrink while competing on the international stage for customers. By ""producing"" teaching more efficiently, resources can also be released to fund international best-practice research. Universities are the Cathedrals of the Modern Age but they are no longer sacred cows. The Dawkins revolution of the 1980s was, in some aspects, not well thought out: it turned competent trainers of nurses and teachers (colleges of advanced education) into low-quality ""export sector"" universities. And now, the chickens have come home to roost – or rather, billions of dollars of export revenue will be lost as Chinese students stay home. Semi-privatised universities have responded to incentives and have massively expanded degrees that are cheap to provide and from which comes a supply of graduates that vastly exceeds demand. Law degrees may train the mind but students and parents should be provided with reliable information about the probability of landing specific jobs. While such degrees are privately profitable for universities, it is socially wasteful for students to have to start again after graduating. Other mismatches can be minimised by having lectures freely available for students to sample before they commit. In 1917, future French prime minister Georges Clemenceau snapped: ""War is too important to be left to the generals."" Human capital formation – the key to increased productivity – is too important to be left to the poorly conceived private incentives we currently provide to our universities.

It comes as private schools draw up their own back-to-class plans, with one dividing the rest of the school year into two long terms and inviting all students back in mid-May and others focusing on the return of senior high school and kindergarten. Ms Berejiklian said public schools would begin to offer face-to-face learning to some students from May 11 but said most would continue remote learning due to continuing COVID-19 transmission fears. Premier Gladys Berejiklian wants students to resume face-to-face learning, but not all at the same time.Credit:Nick Moir The government was considering implementing a roster system ""to provide at least some aspect of face-to-face [teaching] for each student"", which was yet to be determined but could mean students attended on certain days. ""Students will not be at school full-time, students will not be in a classroom with all of their classmates,"" Ms Berejiklian said. ""It will be a limited number of students every day."" More details are expected next week. NSW Department of Education secretary Mark Scott said, ""the department will be working closely with school principals to plan how a staged return of students would work best in different school settings from Week Three. Consultation has commenced with principal groups."" But principals struggled to understand how the plan could work. ""Much of what the state government is advocating is not possible,"" said Julie Townsend, principal of St Catherine's Waverley. ""Social distancing students is unrealistic - corridors are too small; classrooms are too small. Asking teachers to teach each of their classes online for half the time and face to face for the other half is an unreasonable burden of work."" Secondary Principals Council acting president Craig Petersen said public school principals had not yet been consulted but were expecting to meet department officials next week. ""It's not practical at all, on so many levels,"" he said. ""How do we determine which students are attending on any given day? If you've got two children - and the reason we're wanting kids to come back to school is to enable you to work - but they're not going to school on the same day, you're going to send them both anyway. I don't think it eases parental confusion at all."" SCEGGS principal Jenny Allum said a staged return to school would be far more complicated in practice than theory. ""It's easy to wave your hand and say, 'We'll move to a staged approach,' "" she said. ""But it's a mammoth logistical exercise to think about how schools could open partially. What would that look like? Four square metres per kid in a classroom; is that on or off? If it's on, I don't know how to do it. If it's off, why is it off in schools but not other places?"" Santa Sabina College principal Paulina Skerman said teachers could not be expected to deliver face-to-face and online learning concurrently. ""I'd love to see how they think this might work because it sounds very messy,"" she said. While private schools were not required to follow the government's plan, Ms Skerman hoped it would apply across the board, so non-government schools were not left in the position where they had to draw up their own rules. But some already have their own strategy. Barker College has extended school holidays by two weeks, until May 11, and will divide the rest of the year into two long terms, with week-long mid-term breaks, to increase face time in the second half of the year when restrictions were likely to ease. ""If you back-load the year, you have nothing to lose ... and plenty to gain,"" said principal Phillip Heath. ""We go to school to be together and that's what kids want."" Mr Heath will invite students to return to the school from term two, and ""I'm hoping that we get 70 to 80 per cent of people back, subject to health advice."" St Catherine's was considering bringing years 11, 12 and kindergarten back for face-to-face teaching ""for a couple of weeks, and work up gradually to all year groups from there,"" said Dr Townsend. Kambala principal Shane Hogan did not think Ms Berejiklian's proposal was practical. ""A real solution to me would be to get year 12 back to the classroom, and the infants back to the classroom,"" he said. ""If we concentrated on the little and older ones, and kept the ones in the middle remote, it could work. They are the parents who are making the most noise ... the rest have adapted really well."" Many parents, particularly those with younger children, have struggled to supervise home learning while working. But while health experts say children are not at particular risk from COVID-19, teachers worry about their own safety. The NSW Teachers Federation has proposed a staged return, beginning with year 12 and kindergarten. ""The number of students and teachers present must allow four square metres per person, and one-and-a-half-metre distancing,"" said president Angelo Gavrielatos.

52,/national/macquarie-university-to-accept-students-based-on-year-11-results-20200417-p54kt2.html,Macquarie University to accept students based on year 11 results,"Macquarie University will accept students based on their year 11 results next year, as the troubled tertiary sector focuses on securing domestic enrolments while international student numbers collapse. Vice-chancellor Bruce Dowton said year 12 students and their families were worried about how the COVID-19 crisis, and its potential impact on the HSC, would affect their university entry, so this decision gave them certainty. Macquarie University vice-chancellor Bruce Dowton. ""We think at the moment, because of the anxiety we've heard about, making a move on our early entry programs is a really wise thing to do,"" he said in an interview. ""They do need to finish year 12. Our experience with these programs is that the students we take on perform as well as if not better than students we take under the pure ATAR scheme."" The HSC will be awarded this year, but NSW Education Standards Authority is yet to reveal whether exams or major projects will proceed. The Herald understands NESA wants exams to go ahead, but, if that is impossible, results could still be calculated on assessments or teacher estimates. Macquarie already had two pre-existing early-access programs based on year 11 results, which accounted for 43 per cent of its intake this year. One of the programs recognised leadership and achievement, and the other combined results with a school recommendation. The number of students accepted under those programs had been limited, but the cap will now be lifted and the new entry regime will apply to all courses apart from co-op programs, which require students to gain practical experience in a business. The Australian National University has also announced it will admit undergraduate students based on their year 11 results. Last year Macquarie University predicted zero growth in international or domestic students, forcing it to take hardline budget measures such as a staff freeze. Professor Dowton said its recent strategy to reduce reliance on overseas students, which had already been dropping, has helped it weather the COVID-19 crisis. The international student market has collapsed for all universities due to COVID-19 travel bans, but domestic demand – which is much less lucrative, with modest student fees and a government subsidy – is likely to increase due to fewer employment options for school leavers. Professor Dowton said the university would not ""balloon out"" its domestic student enrolments during the crisis. ""It's about quality; what we are doing here is trying to reposition the early intake programs out of respect for the unprecedented situation,"" he said. The number of students graduating from high school in NSW has been stable for several years. But Andrew Norton, from the Centre for Social Research and Methods at ANU, said domestic enrolments would likely increase next year because most gap years – a 12-months work or travel break before university, usually taken by about 10 per cent of students – would be cancelled. ""Even though the total number of persons interested may not change massively, the number of students who may want to start next year will,"" he said. ""We've seen in past recessions that attrition [those dropping out of courses] drops, more of the people who are currently enrolled will stay. Those factors will mean there will be more [domestic] students next year than we would have thought. ""That's one bit of good news for the universities, provided the government increases the funding to match the additional students."" Universities would not scramble for domestic enrolments unless the government re-introduced a demand-driven system, which was unlikely, Professor Norton said. However, ""clearly a couple of universities are nervous about their numbers for next year, they want to make sure they lock in as many numbers as possible"", he said. Some education experts say universities' decisions to bypass the ATAR this year should lead to a review of whether a tertiary entrance ranking system was needed at all. ""Other universities should follow suit and use this ‘pandemic opportunity’ as a moment to rethink entrance scores and more broadly secondary education for all students,"" said Jane Hunter, an education academic at the University of Technology Sydney.

Ms Berejiklian said that without a plan to stagger the return to school, students could face up to a year or longer at home. Opposition education spokeswoman Prue Car said Labor supported a staggered return to face-to-face teaching, but said parents needed certainty about what form the rostering would take. ""What exactly does a roster mean, and what does that mean for parents planning their families lives for the next term,"" Ms Car said.

With the country turning to online education, remote work and tele-health during the COVID-19 crisis, community organisations have been calling for help for vulnerable Australians without internet connections. NBN Co chief executive Stephen Rue said the measures were ""unprecedented"".Credit:Edwina Pickles A $50 million centrepiece of the package will waive a $37 wholesale charge on basic 25Mbps internet plans to allow telcos on the national broadband network to lower their prices between April and September. ""This is intended to help make education accessible to all Australian students who are home schooling in response to social distancing measures,"" Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said. Further relief for internet providers aims to help them maintain connections for households that are struggling financially. Similar relief will be available for small and medium businesses that have suffered during the pandemic. There will also be a dedicated support package for essential workers and emergency services aimed at providing them with boosted connections and priority resolution of faults. The measures announced by NBN Co will be opt-in for internet providers, who will decide what offers they make to customers. Some have already introduced a range of support initiatives for customers. Mr Fletcher said: ""We expect and encourage all internet providers to pass the benefits of NBN Co's relief measures on to end users of the service."" NBN Co chief executive Stephen Rue said the government-owned business had a key role to play in supporting struggling households and businesses.

Replay   Teresa Corbin, chief executive of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, welcomed the announcement. ""NBN Co is to be applauded for laying the groundwork to keep struggling families and households connected during this difficult time. We hope to see the nation's retail service providers build on these foundations to deliver financial relief to those in need,"" she said. The government has also announced a set of principles jointly with the telecommunications industry aimed at providing an industry-wide ""baseline"" on supporting vulnerable customers. The principles include a willingness to waive certain fees and charges for customers in hardship, a commitment to not unilaterally disconnect struggling customers, and deferral of debt collection.

""This is intended to help make education accessible to all Australian students who are home schooling in response to social distancing measures,"" Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said. Further relief for internet providers aims to help them maintain connections for households that are struggling financially. Similar relief will be available for small and medium businesses that have suffered during the pandemic. There will also be a dedicated support package for essential workers and emergency services aimed at providing them with boosted connections and priority resolution of faults. The measures announced by NBN Co will be opt-in for internet providers, who will decide what offers they make to customers. Some have already introduced a range of support initiatives for customers. Mr Fletcher said: ""We expect and encourage all internet providers to pass the benefits of NBN Co's relief measures on to end users of the service."" NBN Co chief executive Stephen Rue said the government-owned business had a key role to play in supporting struggling households and businesses. ""The unprecedented measures we are announcing today reflect our commitment to the telecommunications industry in helping to deliver a whole-of-industry solution to these consumer and business segments which have been hit hard by the pandemic,"" he said. Replay   Teresa Corbin, chief executive of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, welcomed the announcement. ""NBN Co is to be applauded for laying the groundwork to keep struggling families and households connected during this difficult time. We hope to see the nation's retail service providers build on these foundations to deliver financial relief to those in need,"" she said. The government has also announced a set of principles jointly with the telecommunications industry aimed at providing an industry-wide ""baseline"" on supporting vulnerable customers. The principles include a willingness to waive certain fees and charges for customers in hardship, a commitment to not unilaterally disconnect struggling customers, and deferral of debt collection.

The blow from each six-month intake of foreign students lost could equate to the hit the economy took when Australia lost its entire car manufacturing industry. The country’s eight most prestigious universities face the largest loss of revenue, because of their greater intake of international students, but smaller and regional universities are also likely to suffer severe financial consequences that could force them to shed staff and cut back on courses. Universities face an estimated hit of $10b to $19b in lost revenue from international students. Credit:Louie Douvis Modelling by Victoria University’s Mitchell Institute projects that Australia’s university sector will lose between $10 billion and $19 billion between 2020 and 2023, depending on how quickly the nation’s borders are reopened to students. A further $20 billion to $38 billion in wider benefits to the national economy would also be lost. The overall projection could result in a hole in the economy of between $30 billion and $60 billion. Mitchell Institute policy fellow Peter Hurley said  each six-monthly intake of students missed due to travel restrictions would deliver an estimated economic blow equivalent to when Australia lost its entire car manufacturing industry. “International university students are a pipeline, so if you miss a six-month intake it is revenue that is not going to be in the system for two to three years,” Mr Hurley said. “It really is a worst-case scenario for universities.” The revenue universities have drawn from international students increased by 137 per cent between 2008 and 2018, the institute’s report, Australian Investment in Education: Higher Education, states. International university students spent $3.72 billion on fees in 2008 and $8.83 billion in 2018. International student numbers grew 58 per cent in that time, meaning universities also increased their fees to international students. “There are more of them and [universities] are charging them more,” Mr Hurley said of the sector's increasing reliance on international students. Meanwhile, revenue from domestic students increased 43.2 per cent as student numbers grew 37.5 per cent, but without a comparable hike in tuition fees. Victoria and NSW combined draw slightly more than two-thirds of total Australian revenue from international students, claiming $5.99 billion out of a sector-wide $8.76 billion in 2018.   Six universities made more than half of their student revenue from international students, including the University of Melbourne, Monash University, the University of Sydney, the University of NSW, the University of Queensland and Federation University in Ballarat. Mr Hurley said the larger universities were in a healthy financial position before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and had resources to draw on during lean times. Most smaller universities had less reliance on foreign students but also had less in reserve and would likely be forced to make tough decisions. “They’re not going to go bust but they will have to cut costs – they will cut staff, they will cut courses,” Mr Hurley said. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Morrison government has guaranteed $18 billion in funding for universities' domestic education in 2020, pegging the support at expected student numbers before the hit to enrolments from the pandemic. Ordinarily, it would be revised down throughout the year if student numbers were lower than anticipated. Universities have welcomed the government support but warned it does not address the ""big hole"" in revenue from the loss of international students. International education providers have also been alarmed about long-term damage to Australia’s reputation after Prime Minister Scott Morrison recently said it was “time to go home” for foreign students and workers who couldn’t support themselves. Education consultant Claire Field said the lack of support being shown to international students by the Australian government right now could also do lasting reputational damage to the university sector. ""Our approach is in sharp contrast to the UK, NZ and Canadian governments, all of whom are extending to international students the same support they’re providing their citizens,"" Ms Field said. Ms Field said international student enrolments plummeted by 20 per cent 10 years ago following a spate of attacks on Indian students, which attracted overseas media focus. ""If Australia doesn’t provide financial assistance to international students who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis I expect the damage to the sector to be far greater this time,"" she said.

While Britain and the United States are reeling from a combined 40,000 deaths so far as a result of this pandemic, Australia is paralysed over something as elementary as who should go to school, which dominated the agenda at the national cabinet meeting on Thursday. This fact alone demonstrates the stark international differences in our COVID-19 journeys. Sadly, much of Australia’s division is party political. Premiers are tugged towards consistency by the centripetal force of the national cabinet but back home, education unions arm-wrestle the premiers into harder lines to close down schools for all but the most needy. Scott Morrison addresses the media after the national cabinet meeting on Thursday.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The national cabinet needs to sing from one sheet. Public health has already determined that essential services can remain open. That includes schools. It is time to let the doctors do the diagnosing and teachers get on with their profession. No teacher would determine hospital surgical priorities. So it is reasonable to ask why education unions are taking solo flights on public health. As the Prime Minister said after Thursday's meeting, teachers face more danger in the staffroom than in their classrooms. As Sting sang in his immortal tune, Don’t Stand So Close To Me. Replay   Australia is now reporting fewer than two new COVID-19 cases per million each day and only 2 per cent of those are school age. There is minimal, if any, evidence that children catch or spread this disease at school. Just three years ago, Australian schools didn’t miss a beat as 1255 people died of the flu and an estimated 29,000 people were hospitalised over the season. But three years later, with just 350 COVID-19 cases in hospital, unions suddenly make their own diagnosis on school attendance. When a South Australian year 8 student caught COVID-19 from a close contact and school staff member, it was illustrative on two counts. First, this was an adult infection of a child, not the other way around. Second, when the odd child gets COVID-19, it is a front page story. National cabinet made it crystal clear who should return to school yesterday. Everyone. About a third of families are made up of either a single working parent or two working parents. If their work wasn’t essential, they wouldn’t be paid to do it. This group is queuing at the school gates and employers are watching the clock. Vulnerable children must also go back, including any children with special needs where home learning simply won’t succeed. Parents of these children don’t wear T-shirts saying they are vulnerable, so principals must actively seek those parents out and welcome them. Same goes for parents where appropriate care arrangements aren’t available. Many home businesses can’t facilitate learning at home. Often the parent that could do it is the one employed. Finally, children, who despite parents’ best efforts, struggle to learn in a home environment for any unavoidable reason should be welcomed back. Only a bum of a principal would turn them away. Much of the education union banter online has been stoking irrational teacher fears, like catching the disease from students. Teachers face more risk from other teachers and even that risk is far less than what faces the rest of the economy, because teachers are isolated in classrooms for much of the working day. More concerning are inferences that returning children is a lifestyle choice for lazy parents. In the overwhelming majority of cases, non-working parents simply trust that teachers teach better than they can. Independent Schools Queensland executive director David Robertson put it succinctly – this debate is about acting in the students’ best interest, informed by the latest health advice. Synchronising is key. Unions need to stop raising the white flag during this pandemic. Complaints about lack of hand sanitiser, student distancing or risks for older teachers can be solved with a little planning and innovation by administrators; the kind of agility the rest of the economy is showing through this crisis. Slamming the gate on children simply to cull attendance prevents that innovation from occurring. During this lockdown, schools won’t be full. That is thanks to parents with the skills to teach at home. As we have all conceded to home-schooling parents in the past, it is a feat much harder than we realised. Like trusting your family GP, parents prefer to entrust their child's learning to a teaching professional. A third of families are also paying fees throughout COVID-19 for the privilege. For these reasons, whatever the politics dictates, school is safe for children and we need to normalise attendance from next term.

And now, the Prime Minister pleads, think of the children. The term of a million weeks finally came to an end and our teachers breathed a collective sigh of relief. Two weeks to take stock and, as the metaphor goes, stop changing the tyre while the truck is hurtling down the highway. Then the Prime Minister pleads with them to return to the classroom, emphasising after the national cabinet meeting on Thursday that classrooms are the best places for children to learn. Teachers are still leading childrens' learning when they are at home. This follows his comments on Wednesday, when teachers busy trying to prepare for remote learning might have paused to catch sight of the Prime Minister calling on them to walk back through the school gates, telling them that “the education of our children hangs in the balance”. He doesn’t want children “giving up a whole year of their learning”. Teachers were mystified by this. To begin with, the idea that classroom teachers — or even most school leaders — have any say over whether schools are open or ""closed"" is absurd.

It’s hard to fathom that at the very point in time when teachers are collectively working harder than they ever have before, that they should be accused of somehow letting the side down. A reminder that teachers already set a high bar — it’s a mighty difficult job at the best of times — in the interests of their students. Right now, we must have national conversation about what schooling and learning are — and what they are not. The new principles are a departure point but they don’t get to the essence of either. Social distancing is difficult to achieve in schools.Credit:Quentin Jones Let’s start with the conversation about ""home schooling"". What is happening now is not home schooling. In home schooling, parents design learning for their kids. They map learning activities to the curriculum. They assess learning. On the basis of this assessment, they make decisions about what needs to happen next. An integral part of home schooling is usually an array of social and community activities, from Girl Guides to gallery visits to the local football club, none of which is available right now. If children are learning at home, following a course of study painstakingly designed by their teachers, with whom they have regular contact via a variety of means, they are not being “home schooled”. To call what’s happening in this situation “home schooling” undermines the extraordinary work of our teachers, who are engaged in the Herculean effort of rethinking every aspect of their practice with an eye to maintaining the quality of teaching and learning. Not to mention that it puts ridiculous and unnecessary pressure on parents, most of whom are neither teachers nor home schoolers. So let’s call it ""schooling from home"". Neither are teachers who have spent untold time and effort rethinking and reshaping their lessons for students to engage with at home shirking their responsibility to teach. The Prime Minister had it wrong when he said on Wednesday “I kept my kids in school up until the last week because they weren't getting taught at school in that last week, I mean, they were sitting in a room looking at a screen; that's not teaching, that's childminding”. The teachers at Mr Morrison’s daughters’ school were surprised surely to hear that they spent the final week of term one babysitting. That’s not what online teaching feels like to anyone. The job of the teacher, in a nutshell, is to create the conditions for student learning. It’s not to stand in front of the class and ""deliver"" the curriculum or to magically transmit knowledge from one brain to another. Yes, being co-located with your students helps, because an important part of being able to create the conditions for learning is really knowing your students, being able to read the room, but it’s simply not the case that teaching, much less learning, happens only in the classroom. When teachers are pedalling as fast as they can to create good conditions for their students’ learning without having access to their physical classrooms — and I know from my serial lurking on teachers’ social media groups that they are — it doesn’t follow that we’re looking down the barrel of students “giving up a whole year of their learning”. Yes, there is a problem with equity of access only not all students have adequate equipment for schooling at home, including internet access. And, of course, some students need to be at school because their parents need to be at work, or for welfare-related reasons. Nobody, however, is suggesting that those children be denied access to school, and indeed teachers and school leaders are working hard to make sure they aren’t. Some acknowledgement of those efforts is necessary. Schools are workplaces for students, teachers and other adults. In most schools, neither classrooms nor staff-rooms are spacious — your average office worker’s cubicle set-up looks like salubrious accommodation compared to most school staff-rooms. Morrison was right when he pointed out the staffroom could be a risky place for teachers to be. At a time when social distancing orders prevent us from moving around freely or catching up for dinner with a couple of friends, it makes no sense for teachers and students to be sent back to the confines of the classroom or the staffroom. Social distancing measures put in place for workers in other essential services are simply not able to be rolled out in schools full of students and teachers — there’s literally not enough space. It might be a safe enough environment for students because of their age (I don’t dispute the public health experts on this) but if it’s not safe for lawyers or waitstaff or academics or parliamentarians to be in their workplaces right now, it’s not safe for teachers and their families either.

It might be a safe enough environment for students because of their age (I don’t dispute the public health experts on this) but if it’s not safe for lawyers or waitstaff or academics or parliamentarians to be in their workplaces right now, it’s not safe for teachers and their families either.

Even given the significant interruption to the school year as a result of the pandemic. The million-dollar question, though, is how will a student's ATAR be decided? The answer is crucial as the ATAR is used to numerically rank students across the nation in terms of performance and to decide which students are allowed entry into much sought after courses like medicine and law. Relying on school-based assessments or a general intelligence like the SAT is not the solution.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer In a normal school year the results achieved by students in their particular state and territory are transformed into the one statistical national measure – the Australian Tertiary Admission rank (ATAR). In arriving at a student's year 12 score (on which the ATAR is based) the various states and territories employ both school-based assessment tasks and external examinations that are usually held at the end of the school year. Whereas the school-based tasks are generally set and marked by teachers at the school level the end of year examinations are state-wide, externally set and marked and all students sit the examinations under the same conditions. School-based assessment tasks are considered less reliable and rigorous compared to external examinations given the difficulties involved in verifying students' work and ensuring comparability of grades and assessment across different schools. The reality is that some schools and teachers might be easy markers and inflate students' grades while other schools enforce stricter standards. To address the issue Victoria ensures students sit the General Achievement Test (GAT) – a three-hour test involving general knowledge and skills that is used to assist in identifying whether school-based assessments are credible comparable to the results achieved in the external examinations. Much of the debate surrounding how best to deal with year 12 and tertiary entry centres around these three elements: external examinations versus school-based assessment versus a general achievement test like the GAT. One approach is to scrap external examinations and rely on school-based assessments carried out over year 11 and 12 to decide tertiary entry. Both the University of Western Australia and the Australian National University have signalled they will base entry on year 11 school-based assessments. As suggested, the weakness is that it is impossible to ensure the grade a student receives in one school is comparable to the grade given in another. Verifying students' work completed outside the classroom is also a problem. A second approach it to replace examinations and school-based assessments with a general intelligence test like American Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The SAT is a standardised test evaluating reading, writing and mathematical skills unlike an examination where students are tested on the knowledge associated with a particular subject like literature, history, physics or chemistry. The problem with basing tertiary entrance on a general intelligence test is that the focus is on competencies and skills instead of the essential knowledge and understanding associated with particular subjects. If the focus in year 12 is on successfully completing an intelligence test the danger is less effort, energy and time will be spent teaching students the subject-based knowledge and understanding essential for undertaking first year tertiary studies like physics, chemistry, literature and history. What's to be done? On the assumption that students are back at school early to mid-May the best solution is to put formal examinations back to late November/early December. Relying on school-based assessments or a general intelligence like the SAT is not the solution. The focus must be on end of year examinations to ensure rigour and equity. Given the truncated year examinations could be cut back so a three-hour English examination, for example, is reduced to two hours. Reducing the number of year 12 subjects a student needs to undertake in order to successfully complete year 12 is also an option. Given the 2020 cohort of students will not be as well prepared for tertiary studies it's also vital that universities and colleges invest in bridging courses to ensure students, especially disadvantaged ones, have the best chance of coping with first-year tertiary studies. While there is no easy solution to the year 12 imbroglio – end of year external examinations should be the first priority.

Drew Pavlou, an outspoken activist on human rights issues and critic of UQ's strong ties to Beijing, faces a disciplinary hearing later this month and possible expulsion following complaints about his protest activities and comments on social media. University of Queensland student Drew Pavlou. Credit:Attila Csaszar The university has presented 11 allegations of misconduct against Mr Pavlou, 20, arguing his activities breached integrity and harassment policies and the student charter. The university said he harmed its reputation, engaged in intimidating and disrespectful conduct and disrupted normal staff operations. While the 186-page document outlining the allegations is confidential, Mr Pavlou said they included social media comments about the Hong Kong protests where he identified himself as speaking ""on behalf of the university"" as an elected student representative on the UQ senate. Another incident involved him putting a sign on the university's Chinese government-funded Confucius Institute in March, declaring it was a COVID-19 ""biohazard"" and posting a photo of the act on Facebook. Others involved his commentary about vice-chancellor Peter Hoj and the university and crass comments towards other students. Mr Pavlou said many of the allegations were ""frivolous"" and ""petty"", focusing on satirical comments he had made in online forums. ""They have trawled through to find anything they can throw at me,"" he said. ""How many other students have posted risqué stuff online and gotten a 186-page document outlining complaints?"" He said the university was targeting him because of his political activism and wanted to intimidate him into silence or expel him. A spokeswoman for the university said it expected students to comply with conduct policies and charters ""that reflect both the organisation's values and community expectations"". The disciplinary process was to deal with alleged contraventions, the spokeswoman said.  ""The university rejects Mr Pavlou’s statement that the university’s process is an attempt to penalise him for airing his political beliefs,"" she said. Olivia Brumm, president of the student guild at the Queensland University of Technology, has reviewed the complaints document and said the university had highlighted a number of ""absurdly trivial or obviously satirical"" statements, compiling them ""to make it seem like a significant case"". ""I genuinely think it spreads like a personal vendetta by UQ against one of their students and it really does bring into focus the issue of free speech and expression,"" she said.  An online petition in support of Mr Pavlou had gathered 10,000 signatures by Thursday afternoon. Liberal MPs James Paterson, Tim Wilson and Amanda Stoker – who have been vocal in the debate about free speech at universities and critical of Chinese government influence on campuses – urged the university to tread carefully. Senator Paterson said he had never met Mr Pavlou and would likely disagree with him on most political issues but he was ""alarmed by the possibility he is being punished for his activism on China"". ""I haven’t seen the allegations against him but they would have to be incredibly serious to justify expulsion. I would be gravely concerned if they relate to the free speech he has every right to exercise as a student, and I will be watching the outcome very closely,"" he said.

Like most educators, never in my wildest dreams did I think we would ever have to deliver our whole school’s education remotely. Nor did I think I’d find myself in a position of worrying about my entire school community’s physical and mental wellbeing at the same time. We are all grappling with the idea of conducting the entirety of term two from our homes.Credit:Tanya Macheda And while the past few weeks have been enormously challenging, there have been quite a few silver linings presented along the way that have helped to boost our confidence and will allow us to lead with optimism, if somewhat cautiously, into term two. While we are all grappling with the idea of conducting the entirety of term two from our homes – from physical education to science and math – it’s clear that the ability to innovate and problem solve is helping us move forward. Giving teachers the agency to adapt and apply creativity in delivering lessons to students has been a masterclass in what it means to be agile in the 21st Century. In no time at all, teachers have dramatically pivoted the way they conduct their work and deliver learning to children. Teachers who may not have been ones to necessarily assume leadership positions in the past have stepped up and are taking charge of collaborating with other teachers across year levels and disciplines. I myself have most recently collaborated with principals from other schools to work through shared hurdles and am grateful to now be able to find common solutions with those who may have previously been deemed ""competitors"". When it comes to students, they have risen to the challenge and have shown us that they’re capable and resilient when it’s needed the most. In fact, many of our students have checked in with their teachers to ask about their wellbeing and offer support. Certainly, it is our job as educators to pastorally care for our students, and for school leaders to check in on staff for the same reasons, but how beautiful it is that our students think to do this for their teachers. Teenagers are, after all, not as self-obsessed as they sometimes are made out to be. One can’t help but feel for this year’s Year 12 cohort, for whom it has already been a difficult year. It’s now more important than ever for parents to be aware of their children’s mental health, how the family dynamic feeds into that, and what positive practices can be used to support their wellbeing during this time. There’s a long-held misconception that emerging technology has made younger generations socially distant – inept even. However, it is now clear that social proximity is something we’ll always crave as humans and the advent of modern technology means that social distancing and isolation need not turn into social isolation. The camaraderie of their peers is exactly what many children will need at this time. And while families face the prospect of sharing the kitchen dining table for the next couple of months, these new ways of working will also serve as a lesson for students on what the future of work will look like for them. For older children, the next term will be an important lesson in managing self-motivation and self-care in a future where remote work will be a far more common occurrence for them. It goes without saying that for today’s school-aged children, the COVID-19 crisis will be a defining moment in time for the rest of their lives. If we do well to step up to the challenge now, we can perhaps instil some lessons that will enable them to face their next challenge with optimism and acuity.

New social distancing measures to ensure teachers can safely return to classrooms in the coming weeks will be considered at the national cabinet on Thursday, as state and territory leaders attempt to plan the road out of the coronavirus crisis for the nation's students. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian wants students back in classrooms early next term.Credit:Peter Rae Mr Morrison will press his counterparts to switch from large-scale remote learning to more face-to-face lessons by May, while attempting to address the concerns of teachers and parents. He appeared at odds with premiers on Wednesday over the advice to parents about whether they should send their children back to school despite ""clear"" advice from medical authorities that it was safe to do so. Deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said the evidence suggested school children were not major spreaders of the virus, revealing that 136 children aged between five and 18 had tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, ""representing only 2 per cent of our total number of cases"". In her strongest comments yet on schooling arrangements, Ms Berejiklian said she was keen for ""face-to-face"" teaching to return in NSW although said homeschooling would continue initially. But, unlike Mr Morrison's strong position, Ms Berejiklian has not indicated she will be insisting all parents send their children back to school when term two resumes on April 27. Ms Berejiklian said health authorities were giving close consideration to how schools would operate after the holidays, but she expected the status quo to continue into the first weeks of the new term. ""Beyond that point I would like to see a change and we're working towards that,"" Ms Berejiklian said. ""I support the principle that we should have more face-to-face opportunities for students."" In a move aimed at cementing his position ahead of national cabinet, Mr Morrison used social media to urge teachers to return to school, warning children's education ""hangs in the balance"". ""It’s so important that children are able to keep physically going to school,"" Mr Morrison said in a Facebook video message on Wednesday. Mr Morrison said he did not expect schools would return to full attendance for the coming weeks, if not months, but wanted to move to a ""functional attendance"" at school.

New social distancing measures to ensure teachers can safely return to classrooms in the coming weeks will be considered at the national cabinet on Thursday, as state and territory leaders attempt to plan the road out of the coronavirus crisis for the nation's students. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian wants students back in classrooms early next term.Credit:Peter Rae Mr Morrison will press his counterparts to switch from large-scale remote learning to more face-to-face lessons by May, while attempting to address the concerns of teachers and parents. He appeared at odds with premiers on Wednesday over the advice to parents about whether they should send their children back to school despite ""clear"" advice from medical authorities that it was safe to do so. Deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said the evidence suggested school children were not major spreaders of the virus, revealing that 136 children aged between five and 18 had tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, ""representing only 2 per cent of our total number of cases"". In her strongest comments yet on schooling arrangements, Ms Berejiklian said she was keen for ""face-to-face"" teaching to return in NSW although said homeschooling would continue initially. But, unlike Mr Morrison's strong position, Ms Berejiklian has not indicated she will be insisting all parents send their children back to school when term two resumes on April 27. Ms Berejiklian said health authorities were giving close consideration to how schools would operate after the holidays, but she expected the status quo to continue into the first weeks of the new term. ""Beyond that point I would like to see a change and we're working towards that,"" Ms Berejiklian said. ""I support the principle that we should have more face-to-face opportunities for students."" In a move aimed at cementing his position ahead of national cabinet, Mr Morrison used social media to urge teachers to return to school, warning children's education ""hangs in the balance"". ""It’s so important that children are able to keep physically going to school,"" Mr Morrison said in a Facebook video message on Wednesday. Mr Morrison said he did not expect schools would return to full attendance for the coming weeks, if not months, but wanted to move to a ""functional attendance"" at school. ""Obviously, the populations will be lower, which is greater opportunity to ensure better social distancing practices in the classrooms which protect teachers,"" Mr Morrison told Perth radio.

74,/education/selective-school-entry-scores-fall-even-at-james-ruse-20200415-p54k1h.html,Selective school entry scores fall - even at James Ruse,"The minimum scores needed for entry into the state's selective schools have fallen by as much as 21 points this year after major changes to the test were implemented. Cut-offs fell across 38 of the 44 fully and partially selective schools for which scores are published, compared to last year's cut-offs. Scores are not published for three agricultural schools. In comparison, entry scores fell for only five schools last year, and jumped by up to 16 points at some schools. The biggest increase this year was six points. Students who sat the test in mid-March experienced initial changes designed to make access to selective schools more equitable for disadvantaged students. The suite of planned changes, which will be phased in over coming years, includes improving the psychometric design of questions so they adapt to students' abilities, making the weighting of English and mathematical abilities more consistent, reducing the predictability and ""coachability"" of the test and addressing the gender gap in the selection process. However, a spokeswoman for the NSW Department of Education said that changes to the test also included ""increasing the degree of difficulty"" but there was not enough evidence to suggest that the small changes have contributed to the drop in cut-offs. About 15,080 students sat the selective school entry test this year.Credit:Hank Van Stuivenberg ""Whilst there may appear to be a ‘drop’ in the minimum entry scores, the information on the Department website shows the score of the last student placed at each selective high school,"" she said. ""As parents decline offers after the school term ends or the school year begins, it sometimes become necessary to go further down a reserve list than may have happened in previous years."" Christina Ho, an associate professor in social and political sciences at the University of Technology Sydney, said the fall in scores could be due to changes to the test as well as changes in demand for places at some schools. ""Obviously the overall fall is something that would be a product of changes to the test but it's hard to know why scores for some schools would have fallen by that much compared to other schools,"" she said. The schools where minimum entry scores fell the most this year were Girraween High, which recorded a drop of 21 points; Smiths Hill High, with a 13-point fall; Alexandria Park Community School, with a 12-point drop; and Northern Beaches Secondary College Manly Campus, Rose Bay Secondary College and Sydney Boys High, with a 10-point fall each. The cut-off for entry to James Ruse Agricultural High, which is the highest in the state, fell by four points this year to 246. It rose nine points last year to reach 250, one of the highest scores in its history. Students can score a maximum of 300 points in the test, of which 200 are scaled test scores and 100 points are scaled school assessment marks. The six schools where entry scores increased include four schools that previously had the lowest cut-offs in the state - Karabar High, which recorded an increase of six points, and Armidale, Auburn Girls and Kooringal, which recorded increases of one point each. The other two schools were Baulkham Hills High, which recorded an increase of four points and now has the second-highest cut-off in the state, and Sydney Secondary College Leichhardt Campus, which also recorded a four-point increase. About 15,080 students sat the entry test this year and there were 4226 places available. There were 14,500 applicants last year, and 4256 places. Jae Jung, a senior lecturer at UNSW and leading researcher in gifted education, said that while changes in entry scores between years were partially due to changes in the entry test, they also fluctuated depending on the cohort and individual school applications. ""Cut-off scores are used to determine how many students will get a place in each school, it's a supply and demand issue,"" Associate Professor Jung said. He said other measures including the socioeconomic backgrounds of students who gained entry to selective schools this year would be a better indication than cut-off scores as to whether changes to the test were working as intended.

In a message to staff on Tuesday, vice-chancellor Ian Jacobs said that if a large number of staff helped reduce the payroll bill, it could significantly reduce ""UNSW's financial difficulties — and therefore the number of job losses we have to consider"". UNSW vice-chancellor Ian Jacobs: ""I understand that this is an incredibly challenging and uncertain time.""Credit:Sanghee Liu Professor Jacobs, who along with other senior managers will take a 20 per cent pay cut, acknowledged it was a ""big ask"" for staff to volunteer to work the same hours for less money in return for additional leave. Any untaken leave would be paid out on completion of employment under this option. Staff were also given the option of taking fewer hours for less pay or taking leave without pay. A third option included taking voluntary retirement or transitioning to part-time employment while moving towards retirement. ""I understand that this is an incredibly challenging and uncertain time and want to assure you that I will leave no option unexplored in seeking to protect as many jobs at UNSW as possible,"" Professor Jacobs said. ""In recent weeks, we have deferred all capital expenditure, frozen travel costs and our senior leaders have imposed significant discretionary budget cuts. We are also stopping or pausing recruitment."" Professor Jacobs said the university was facing a $600 million budget shortfall. UNSW last week said its international student numbers had fallen by 30 per cent after the University of Sydney told staff it expected a $470 million budget loss as a result of a 17 per cent drop in international student enrolments. A UNSW spokeswoman said staff have been asked to consider a range of voluntary measures ""to lessen the impact of future action, including job losses, because of the revenue shortfalls related to the COVID-19 virus"". ""These are voluntary options to help UNSW at this extraordinary time, and no staff member is being pressured to agree to any of these options,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We appreciate that these are significant steps for staff to consider during a very difficult time and understand each staff member’s situation is unique,"" she said. ""We seek to work together with our academic and professional communities so that we can achieve as positive an outcome as possible."" The threat of job losses comes as the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) has warned that the federal government $18 billion relief package for higher education announced on Sunday would do little to help because it was not new money and had already been budgeted. “This will not plug the gaping hole in university finances left by the drop in international student income,” Dr Barnes said. Dr Barnes said local NTEU representatives would meet with UNSW management on Thursday to seek further information about the proposal. The NTEU was also negotiating a job protection strategy with vice-chancellors across the country. Professor Jacobs said the government relief would ""only slightly reduce our $600 million projected shortfall as we had anticipated much of this support"". Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, said the international education sector employed 240,000 people. The closure of boarders and no new student enrolments had put jobs at risk. ""The more a university has come to rely on international student incomes, the more likely it is going to face job security issues going forward,"" he said. Earlier this week, Australian Catholic University vice-chancellor Greg Craven warned that ""some universities obviously got their equations wrong"" in their heavy reliance on high-fee international student enrolments. ""The problem is if you over-concentrate, you do make yourself vulnerable,"" Professor Craven said. ""What worries me is the university system as we knew it, which was not perfect, will never come back again. There has been a fundamental shift and some very good universities are going to find it very hard."" Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan said the government had guaranteed $18 billion in funding for universities even if there is a fall in domestic student numbers and would continue to work with the sector to minimise the financial impact of COVID-19. ""Universities are also working with the NTEU on measures to support staff,"" Mr Tehan said. “We are aware that like the rest of the Australian and global community the university sector is not immune from the financial impact of the virus and that it covers a breadth of people within its communities including professional staff, academics, casual staff, domestic students, and international students. “The government has worked with the commercial banking sector to provide liquidity to the market. The states and Territories have a role to play in ensuring that liquidity is meeting the needs of potential borrowers. We’ve encouraged all universities who think they need additional lending capacity to approach their lenders at this time.""

International students, seen here queuing for food, are not eligible for government support.Credit:Penny Stephens Like other temporary visa holders, the students cannot access social security payments or the JobKeeper wage subsidy, and the government has so far outlined limited support for them, allowing some early access to accumulated superannuation but maintaining that government support payments should prioritise Australian citizens. Universities have announced student hardship funds worth at least $110 million, led by a $25 million fund established at Deakin University. Other commitments include an estimated $21 million in support from the Australian National University, Monash University's $15 million, Flinders University's $12.5 million and RMIT University's $10 million. In addition to grants, universities are providing fee relief, loans and food banks. Private colleges and other providers in the international education market are also providing forms of assistance. International Education Association of Australia chief executive Phil Honeywood is lobbying for a national hardship fund to support the students. ""Firstly, it should be a whole of community humanitarian aid package. This should be not just be providers but also government and philanthropic foundations,"" he said. Mr Honeywood said a hardship fund would ""go some way to reinstating Australia's reputation in our key student source countries"". Countries that compete with Australia for students in the international education market have allowed students access to their emergency welfare schemes. Britain's job-retention scheme is open to all workers, Canada's emergency response benefit is open to some foreign students and New Zealand is offering income support. Mr Honeywood said neither the government nor Labor appeared to support giving the students access to Australia's welfare or job subsidy programs so a dedicated fund was the next best thing.  Replay   Education Minister Dan Tehan said a relief package for the university sector announced on Sunday was ""unashamedly"" focused on domestic students. Mr Tehan has said he and other education ministers were working on ""innovative"" solutions to support international students. ANU higher education researcher Andrew Norton said the students should normally be expected to support themselves but not during the economic shutdown caused by the pandemic. He said the crisis had disproportionately affected industries employing international students and giving them access to JobKeeper would help ensure business continuity through the crisis. ""When you do have a completely unanticipated crisis that means temporary migrants cannot support themselves, a country like Australia that takes the benefits of temporary migrants should also incur the costs,"" he said. He said it was a ""real risk"" that a lack of support would damage the reputation of Australia's international education sector, which was last year worth $39 billion. The revenue now underpins many university budgets and the blow from the crisis could wipe billions from the sector and cost thousands of jobs.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison visiting a classroom in Cape York in mid-2017.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The Flexible Literacy for Remote Primary Schools Program was first funded in 2014 as a three-year trial to improve teacher skills and student literacy across 34 remote schools in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia, and was extended twice until 2019. It used Direct Instruction, a controversial teaching method from the US where teachers read from a scripted lesson plan while students respond orally and as a group. The program was based on a system used in Cape York schools, promoted by Aboriginal community leader Noel Pearson. But research published in The Australian Journal of Indigenous Education, which analysed MySchool data for 25 participating remote schools where more than 80 per cent of students were Indigenous, found the program did not improve reading results despite interim evaluations describing its positive impact. The study by University of South Australia researchers used grade 3 and 5 NAPLAN reading results as a proxy for literacy as well as school attendance rates, to compare outcomes in remote primary schools with and without the program in the three years before and after it began. It found grade 3 reading NAPLAN scores in schools with the program declined by 23.43 points, compared with schools without the program where results increased by 4.47 points. Grade 5 reading scores also declined by 19.48 points, while at other schools they declined by 15.12 points. Researchers John Guenther and Sam Osborne said declining results ""suggest that the intervention has a potential to be associated with educational harm to at least some students"". Average attendance at participating schools also dropped by 7.52 per cent, compared with 2.09 per cent at other schools. ""That is significant, remembering this is in the era of $100 million investment to get kids to school in some of these communities,"" Dr Osborne said. ""It not only suggests the program hasn’t been working, it shows a significant disengagement in schooling, which is the opposite of what both of these programs set out to do."" A House of Representatives standing committee on Indigenous Affairs recommended no further funding be allocated to the program beyond June 2018, but Education Minister Dan Tehan extended it to 2019 on the basis ""the program uses innovative teaching methods to improve literacy results"". Dr Osborne said ""decisions to extend the program were not necessarily based on the available evidence"", with the report noting that one-size-fits-all approaches to education rarely work for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. ""Most of these very remote communities are where English is a second language and they are largely living on traditional lands. They have a rich diversity and a wealth of assets that can be drawn on, in terms of family, local languages, community, community histories and the land itself,"" Dr Osborne said. ""But when you take an off-the-shelf instruction program, you render all of those potential resources as unnecessary and I think that in part contributes to the students feeling like school doesn’t necessarily mirror who they are and where they belong.""

Some are at the mercy of addicted, violent adults. Some go without the food they'd normally be given at school. ""When term begins, it takes us four weeks to get the kids back into the routine of not being in a psychological state of fight or flight,"" says one principal. The longer the COVID-19 crisis continues, the more likely it is that these kids, and many more will slip out of the education system, never to return. Principals fear the COVID-19 crisis will cause some students to drop out of formal education, never to return.Credit:Janie Barrett They are the ones who fight against school at the best of times, those whose McDonald's job has become the only pay cheque left in the family, the ones now responsible for younger siblings. At any one time, at least 50,000 Australian kids are completely detached from formal education. Now that NSW and Victorian schools have moved to at-home learning, that number is expected to skyrocket. ""This is a recipe for massive disaster,"" says Jim Watterson from the University of Melbourne's Graduate School of Education. ""We're not even going to know the extent of it until it's time to go back to school."" Replay   While schools are technically open to vulnerable kids, many ""just will not go"", he says. ""The longer this goes on, the greater the detachment. If you don't complete year 12, it affects your income, your health and social connections for the rest of your life. This is a recipe for massive disaster. We're not even going to know the extent of it until it's time to go back to school. ""It's hard to see a strategy that will let the government pick up on the kids that will be more than just disadvantaged — they will be potentially harmed."" High schoolers are most likely to slip out of the system. Some will be lost in the transition from primary to secondary school, while older kids will find it easier to disappear because schools have less capacity to track their whereabouts. At one disadvantaged school, just one-third of students have logged onto their remote learning material, so teachers are busily tracking down hundreds of students who are unaccounted for. Already, some are not answering their phones. The departmental officers who usually knock on doors or sit down with parents or intercept kids at court appearances if they fall out of the system without permission before age 17 are no longer allowed that close social contact. ""The numbers show that it's the obvious, poorly behaved, low-achieving middle-years boys [dropping out of the system], but lots of girls leave, too, who become detached from school because of mental health issues,"" Watterson says. One principal of a large, regional public high school is worried. ""The longer this goes on, my fear is that we're going to have kids start to leave school,"" she says. There are two groups of students she is most concerned about. The first group is those that are now working full-time at their supermarket or fast-food job because their casual teenage wage is the only money coming into the house after their parents lost their jobs. ""Those jobs will become their station in life, and that's not giving them the opportunities they could have had if they had completed their HSC,"" the principal says. ""The second level are the kids who are highly at risk of either moving into crime or being party to crime. The police are nervous; they've got serious concerns about kids in some houses."" The school is working hard to keep in touch with those students. Teachers have designed a flexible timetable that students can fit around full-time jobs if necessary, and have handed out laptops and Wi-Fi dongles. They have also diverted their food technology budget to buy groceries. ""We're dropping off bread, cheese and ham to their houses,"" the principal says. Mark Morrison runs Macleay Vocational College at Kempsey on the NSW mid-north coast. Some of his students are referred by Juvenile Justice, some are homeless and many come from troubled families. Up to 50 per cent of his kids are still attending school. ""I think it's because I give them food,"" he says. ""That's what they will always come for."" They feel that they belong to this place. I don't think schools are given enough recognition for creating a place where kids are valued. He too is worried about the kids who are not coming. He and his staff drive to the students' homes a few times a week with food and school work. ""We're dropping of little bits of work to them, then we go and pick it up,"" he says. ""Is that a massive cost to me? Yes. But the out-weighing consideration is that they will not turn away from school because they feel we have a genuine care for them."" But not all of his students have homes. Some live in refuges, some live on the streets. Many of his kids are in out-of-home care. Foster families are feeling the pinch of having their charges, often several of them, at home all day, while those who live in residential care are no longer allowed to travel to school. ""We stay in touch with them, we talk to them through a screen,"" Morrison says. ""They feel that they belong to this place. I don't think schools are given enough recognition for creating a place where kids are valued."" Another principal said his staff devoted many hours to chasing truants and disengaged students at the best of times. In the era of COVID-19, that job has become much harder. Easter holidays will make it harder still. ""I don't want the break, that's another removal — we will have less connection with our kids,"" he says. ""The holidays are the worst time for our kids. They're not looking forward to the Easter bunny coming."" Julie Hourigan Ruse, the chief executive of Fams, the peak body for not-for-profits working with vulnerable children, said teachers have been telling her that the students they were most worried about had been the first to disconnect. ""They were first to stay home, to stop going to school,"" she says. ""We know it's difficult to get these kids to school at the best of times, let alone in a world where the Prime Minister and Premier say it's OK.

Education Minister Dan Tehan announced the government would guarantee funding for domestic students based on expected enrolment levels before the pandemic hit. Under the relief package for higher education providers, the government is also creating cut-price online courses for Australians to re-skill at home. Education Minister Dan Tehan said the package would be ""ballast"" for the besieged university sector.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen Mr Tehan said the guarantee of $18 billion for domestic undergraduate education would provide ""ballast"" for the sector to see out the crisis. Ordinarily, the funding would be revised down throughout the year if enrolments dropped. But university sector leaders immediately said the package would not address the billions of dollars in lost revenue from international students. An estimated 21,000 jobs could still be lost in the next six months, Universities Australia chair and Curtin University vice-chancellor Deborah Terry warned. Professor Terry said the package was an ""important first step"" and the guarantee of government funding had prevented ""even higher"" job losses. ""Individual universities are already cutting costs across the board through very substantial reductions in operational spending, deferral of vital capital works, and reductions in senior staff salaries,"" she said, adding the measures would be ""nowhere near enough"" to cover estimated losses of $3 billion to $4.6 billion or more. International education has become a major revenue source for Australian universities over the last decade. The Group of Eight elite universities now rely on it for a third of their funding. A third of the students are Chinese and enrolments have crashed since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei province. Conor King, executive director of the Innovative Research Universities network, said the government's announcement was a ""major step"" towards protecting the viability of university education. ""But the government package is only a partial answer. It still leaves universities facing a big hole in international student fee income, research funding and other commercial income,"" he said. Mr King said more needed to be done to support international students through the crisis. The current university system is based on both domestic and international students and, without the latter, there will be fewer courses and fewer staff, he warned.  Mr Tehan said the funding guarantee had been the ""number one priority"" for universities during negotiations. Asked if there would be any further immediate relief, he said: ""This is the package to get the sector through the pandemic."" Universities are also seeking low-interest loans from banks and state governments. Education ministers are discussing support options for international students.  The discounted online qualifications to be provided by universities and private colleges will start in May and are intended for people to use the economic shutdown to develop skills in priority areas, including healthcare, counselling, teaching maths, languages and engineering. Mr Tehan said there could be capacity for 20,000 enrolments in the courses and they would ""enable people, rather than bingeing on Netflix, to binge on studying"" during the pandemic. Universities are struggling to access the government's JobKeeper wage subsidy program. To be eligible, they must demonstrate a 30 per cent revenue decline or 50 per cent if their turnover is over $1 billion. They were last week excluded from more generous eligibility conditions for registered charities. Alison Barnes, national president of the National Tertiary Education Union, said the funding provided by the government was already factored into university budgets and was not new money. ""This will not plug the gaping hole in university finances left by the drop in international student income,"" Dr Barnes said. ""We’re extremely disappointed that the government will not enable universities to access the JobKeeper subsidy. Without it, tens of thousands of jobs in the sector are still threatened.""

International education has become a major revenue source for Australian universities over the last decade. The Group of Eight elite universities now rely on it for a third of their funding. A third of the students are Chinese and enrolments have crashed since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei province. Conor King, executive director of the Innovative Research Universities network, said the government's announcement was a ""major step"" towards protecting the viability of university education. ""But the government package is only a partial answer. It still leaves universities facing a big hole in international student fee income, research funding and other commercial income,"" he said. Mr King said more needed to be done to support international students through the crisis. The current university system is based on both domestic and international students and, without the latter, there will be fewer courses and fewer staff, he warned.  Mr Tehan said the funding guarantee had been the ""number one priority"" for universities during negotiations. Asked if there would be any further immediate relief, he said: ""This is the package to get the sector through the pandemic."" Universities are also seeking low-interest loans from banks and state governments. Education ministers are discussing support options for international students.  The discounted online qualifications to be provided by universities and private colleges will start in May and are intended for people to use the economic shutdown to develop skills in priority areas, including healthcare, counselling, teaching maths, languages and engineering. Mr Tehan said there could be capacity for 20,000 enrolments in the courses and they would ""enable people, rather than bingeing on Netflix, to binge on studying"" during the pandemic. Universities are struggling to access the government's JobKeeper wage subsidy program. To be eligible, they must demonstrate a 30 per cent revenue decline or 50 per cent if their turnover is over $1 billion. They were last week excluded from more generous eligibility conditions for registered charities. Alison Barnes, national president of the National Tertiary Education Union, said the funding provided by the government was already factored into university budgets and was not new money. ""This will not plug the gaping hole in university finances left by the drop in international student income,"" Dr Barnes said. ""We’re extremely disappointed that the government will not enable universities to access the JobKeeper subsidy. Without it, tens of thousands of jobs in the sector are still threatened.""

Two weeks later at home, that had jumped to 22 per cent. In year 7, one in 10 students were highly distracted at school, increasing to 24 per cent at home two weeks later. Just 9 per cent of year 11, and 8 per cent of year 12 were frequently off-task at school, but that increased to 22 per cent and 20 per cent at home. Year 8 (14 per cent) and year 9 (15 per cent) were most distracted at school, but, as they were coming off a higher base, the increase in the number of distracted students was smaller. Both climbed to 21 per cent. ""We are finding, not unexpectedly, that the amount of distractability has doubled,"" said EdQuire chief executive Michael Cejnar. ""There are twice as many students that are distracted. This is at a top level independent school that's very tight in its tutoring.""

Dr Cejnar said the software was not intended to police students' behaviour. Rather, it let teachers know whether they were succeeding in keeping students engaged. ""Teachers need feedback from students all the time,"" he said. ""Face-to-face is easy, with a computer it's virtually impossible.

Andrew Martin, a professor of educational psychology at the University of NSW, said online learning gave teachers less scope to modify content to needs of different students, as they would in a classroom. While the key to keeping students engaged was varying tasks, video conferencing helped.

Parents could also help by striking the right balance between driving their child, and easing off a bit. ""If there's too much driving and directing, they start feeling controlled and their intrinsic motivation begins declining,"" said Professor Martin. ""Having a philosophy on this is important – parents getting into their own heads what's acceptable. Yes, I want them to do three hours, but would two hours be okay?

Universities and other tertiary education providers have been crying out for support since the pandemic began, warning their viability is at risk from billions of dollars in revenue losses. The disruption has also forced providers to fund a rapid shift to online delivery and support international students in financial hardship. Education Minister Dan Tehan says a relief package will provide ""ballast"" for higher education providers and opportunities for Australians.Credit:SMH The newly announced relief package will guarantee funding for universities this year based on expected levels of Commonwealth-supported domestic enrolments before the hit to student numbers from the crisis. Ordinarily, the amount of funding provided would be revised throughout the year based on variations to enrolments. The government will seek to bolster revenue for universities and private colleges by creating new certificates for six-month, discounted online courses. The courses are targeted at national priority areas and are intended for people to learn new skills during the recession and period of social distancing. ""What this does is provide ballast for the university sector to help and support them through the coronavirus pandemic,"" Education Minister Dan Tehan said. ""For those people who have lost work or might be looking to use this time to transition or reskill in the workforce, we have created for the first time a diploma certificate and we are expanding graduate certificates."" The courses will start in May and focus on priority areas including nursing, teaching, counselling, maths, English, languages, agriculture, allied health, IT, engineering, environmental studies and science. Students can get HELP loans for the courses, which will cost either $1250 or $2500. Mr Tehan said the package could potentially support 20,000 places for the online courses across the sector but the availability will vary between institutions. Some universities have delayed their enrolment deadlines for this semester and are awaiting final confirmation of the decline in student numbers. Mr Tehan said guaranteed government funding levels had been the ""number one priority"" for universities during their negotiations. Asked if there would be any further relief, he said: ""This is the package to get the sector through the pandemic."" A funding increase of $80 million this year for public universities, previously tied to new performance measures, will also be guaranteed. The university sector has estimated it could lose $3 billion to $4.6 billion or more this year.

There are acute fears for smaller universities that lack the margins and financial security of the major institutions. Private colleges could also be at risk, facing similar declines in domestic and international student numbers. The relief package will include regulatory and fee relief for the vocational education and training sector, refunding and waiving fees imposed by regulators and deferring cost recovery requirements.

Little did we know that this year, all of us would be forced to observe the Lenten tradition of giving up the good things in life in pursuit of the greater things. The coronavirus pandemic has taken away many of life's pleasures – drinks with friends, a game of footy, even toilet paper. And while many of us have used the time to pause and appreciate simple moments of life unfolding at home, for others the past 40 days have been anything but peaceful. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on March 23 asks parents to keep their children home.Credit:AAP Life became particularly difficult for working parents on the morning of March 23, when faced with falling attendance levels, Premier Gladys Berejiklian asked parents to keep their children home from school. She did this despite federal health advice that children were not super-spreaders of coronavirus and that schools should remain open. By then, the number of coronavirus cases in Australia had risen to 1680 – with 669 of them in NSW. The state was battling to contain the spread of the illness and the news from Italy each day was bringing home to all of us the horrific consequences of failing to do so. In public schools, 75 per cent of children were still attending but teachers were growing increasingly worried about having to work in unhygienic environments where social distancing was almost impossible. Authorities had to make big decisions quickly. Asking parents to keep their children home was one of them. It allayed the teachers' concerns and reinforced for everyone the importance of social distancing. We have since managed to flatten the curve. This week, NSW has recorded fewer than 90 new cases a day. That gain has come at a huge cost, partly borne by the 766,000 public schoolchildren in NSW who have missed out on proper lessons in a classroom, as well as the interaction with their peers that is critical to their development. School is not just about literacy and numeracy – it is also where you learn how to be part of a community. Children struggle to get that off an iPad, if they are lucky enough to have one. Vulnerable children have also been removed from a safe place where teachers were able to monitor their welfare and report any concerns. And parents are stressed and exhausted from trying to run lessons at home, while also fighting to hold on to their jobs. They have never greeted the school holidays with such relief. The government must use the Easter break to define when it will be safe for students to go back to school and to prepare for their return, in a way that does not unravel the health achievements of the past fortnight. It can start with practical measures - installing soap dispensers and soap – and perhaps mapping out a staggered return of year groups, or alternating the days on which they would attend, to improve social distancing. The workforce can also be rearranged to move older teachers and those with health conditions out of classrooms. The message of Easter Sunday is one of hope. The improving situation in Australia has made us all feel more optimistic. The NSW government must add to this goodwill by giving parents and children some indication of when and how something approaching normal school life will return. Schools may have to close more than once as this pandemic plays out but their closure for months or years on end cannot be the norm. Such a move would carry far too great a social cost.

96,/national/australia-s-coronavirus-safety-net-must-be-tight-to-go-the-distance-20200410-p54iux.html,Australia's coronavirus safety net must be tight to go the distance,"Scott Morrison says lines had to be drawn somewhere. The safety net his government created across eight frenzied days of policy making last month had to leave some workers out. The explanation he gave on Tuesday, at the special sitting of Parliament to pass the government’s historic wages subsidy, underlines the difficulty of designing new payment systems from scratch to cope with a once-in-a-century health crisis. Morrison would not wish for any job to be sacrificed. Yet the signal he sends to employers is that there are two classes of casual workers.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The Prime Minister didn’t put it quite this way, because he is not one to admit regret, let alone fault. But the truth is he didn’t have enough time to ensure that all casual workers could be treated equally. The line he drew was at 12 months. Any casual worker who spent at least a year with their current employer would be eligible for the $1500 a fortnight wage subsidy. Those with fewer than 12 months will have to settle for a generous dole payment of $1117.50 per fortnight if they lose their job. Morrison said 12 months was ""a status that is already recognised under Australia's taxation system"". That is, the Australian Taxation Office can’t get the money to all casual workers at the moment, even if the government wanted it to. It is an administrative distinction that would not pass the pub test that politicians are fond of citing in other circumstances. Why should a casual teacher, or sub-contractor in the building trade with many years of continuous work across multiple employers, have fewer rights than a casual worker who has just completed a year in their first job at a pub? Morrison obviously doesn’t see one line of work as more worthy of protecting than the other. But he will need to come up with a better argument than the deflection he used at question time on Tuesday. ""We put the JobSeeker payment and its increased capacity in place because we knew there would be those who would not be ultimately eligible for other measures we may consider,"" he said. ""When we drew that line, we knew we could do it, knowing full well that we had already acted to put the JobSeeker safety net in place."" Replay   This is the sort of back-to-front logic that politicians resort to when they are playing catch-up. When Morrison announced he would double the dole on March 22, at a cost to the budget of $14 billion, he still hoped that employment would bounce back after the lockdown. Policy was set to address a temporary setback for the economy, not an existential threat. The clue to his thinking was he had no intention of introducing a wages subsidy at that point. On March 25, for instance, he explicitly ruled out the option because it would involve ""an entirely new payment system for that to be achieved, which is never done quickly and is never done well"". The wages subsidy was policy five days later, on March 30, with a price tag of $130 billion, and a target audience of 6 million workers and sole traders. It is a credit to the prime minister, his senior ministers and the public service that they were able to change course so quickly. But it still leaves more than 1 million casual workers on the wrong side of the divide between the wage subsidy and dole. Morrison would not wish for any job to be sacrificed. Yet the signal he sends to employers, for the time being, is that there are two classes of casual workers, and two safety nets, one that runs in co-operation with the government; the other which doesn’t concern them. It makes no economic, or social policy sense because once Morrison accepted the case for a wage subsidy, every job in the economy was, by definition, worth defending. The unemployment rate, like the graph for coronavirus cases, can be bent. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg does have the power to extend the wages subsidy without having to reconvene Parliament, and there is an expectation he will do so at the first available opportunity. But the question for casual workers is whether it is already too late to save those who have lost their jobs. The health metaphor cuts both ways. Just as every Australian is responsible for containing the spread of the virus, every Australian employer, and institution, has a role to play in maintaining the safety net. There has been insufficient energy devoted by government to this aspect of the policy challenge, in part, because there is so little shared experienced of an economic shock on this scale. The last deep recession occurred three decades ago, beyond the professional memory of most politicians, bureaucrats, and chief executives. The 51-year-old Morrison, for instance, was working for the Property Council in 1990-91. The 48-year-old Frydenberg was still at university. This is not to discount their apprenticeships before politics, but to place their cohort in context. Take a step back and consider the people running the organisations which Australians will continue to interact with even during the lockdown: schools, health insurance funds, mobile phone companies, internet service providers, energy companies, local governments and the like. Very few leaders or managers in these organisations will have encountered a challenge in their careers where they were responsible for the livelihoods of staff and customers alike. They have to balance their responsibilities to their own workforces with the ability of Australians to keep paying their bills. Every discount, or deferred payment, risks the knock-on of a staff member having their hours reduced, or being laid off. Yet every bill they insist be paid in full, for a service already compromised, carries systems-wide risks. Private education and health are obvious flashpoints. Both these sectors are being curtailed in the national interest. Students are being taught remotely, to reduce the risk of infection if schools stay open, while elective surgery is put on hold to allow the public system to prepare for the feared surge in coronavirus cases over the winter. One in three of Australia’s 3.95 million students are in the private system – almost 770,000 go to Catholic schools, and a further 580,000 go to independent schools. A larger proportion (44 per cent) of all Australians are covered by private health insurance – more than 11 million people in a population of 25 million. The Commonwealth underwrites both private sectors, but the states administer the public systems. The nightmare scenario for each tier of government is a run on the public system as families pull their children out of private schools, and cancel their private health insurance, stretching the capacity of the states, and forcing the Commonwealth into an unpopular bailout to prop up posh schools and gouging health funds. Australian families entered this recession with education as the fastest growing item in their budget, and health ranked third fastest after domestic power and fuel. At the end of the 1980s, the typical Australian household devoted just 1.2 per cent of their budget to education and 4.3 per cent to medical care and health expenses. Now the figures are 3.1 per cent for education and 5.8 per cent for health, based on the most recent survey for 2015-16. There is no reason why they should remain at these elevated levels if families are battling for financial survival. Recessions carry both short and long-run costs. Unemployment is fast to rise, and very slow to recover. This is understood at a visceral level by every Australian. The last recession effectively ran for three years, from a jobless rate of 5.8 per cent in December to 1989 to 11.2 per cent in December 1992. Another decade passed before the rate of unemployment returned to its pre-recession level of 5.8 per cent, in August 2003. Although the long-run costs are harder to foresee, they inevitably leave their mark well after the economy returns to its new normal. At the federal Treasury, the graduate recruitment program was suspended for a single year in 1992, because the department didn’t have any money, and staff turnover was lower than normal because of the recession. The cost of that decision was felt seven to 10 years later, a source says. ""That crop that would have been knocking on the door for promotion, they weren’t there,"" he says. Every firm that lived through that recession would have suffered a similar skills gap as the economy was moving into overdrive at the turn of the 21st century. Australian families entered this recession with education as the fastest growing item in their budget.Credit:istock The long-term costs of a recession are also borne by young Australians who have not yet entered the labor market. One of the many complications of the coronavirus is the disruption to the 2020 school year. There is a long-forgotten case study that highlights the challenges for students in year 12 in particular. Jeremy Ludowyke, the principal of Melbourne High School, has been thinking back to this example in recent weeks as he prepared the switch to online classes. For him it provides a personal and  professional reminder because he was a student at the school at the time. The 1971 school year is infamous in Melbourne High history. It began with a five-week teachers strike over a range of issues. Two-thirds of the teachers joined the industrial action leaving a skeleton staff of no more than a dozen to run the school. Assignments were hurried to beat the strike, and the internal school exams for terms one and two were cancelled. Ludowyke was in year 11, one year below the class that experienced the greatest level of anxiety. Many of the year 12s, he says, still carry the scars half a century later. ""There was very much a feeling that the teachers had the power to stop this,"" he says. ""The feedback was: ‘You were the ones who did our year in’."" The end of year results did not suffer. But the students believed they were denied the undivided loyalty of their teachers. Ludowyke does not detect a similar anxiety this year. The students do not think the school has it in for them, because the health crisis was not something the teachers could control. But his selective school is better prepared than many in the government sector. The students have been working with devices for the past three years. Ludowyke offers another insight. This generation of students, and their parents, have not experienced genuine hardship before. The exceptions, he says, are the high-achieving local-born children of refugees, and some of the other migrant groups. One of the many challenges for governments in maintaining the safety net this year is to prevent a freefall in confidence in middle Australia. The only way to stop 2020 from becoming a lost year, with resentments running for decades to come, is for every institution to take the side of the people they serve.

97,/national/australia-s-coronavirus-safety-net-must-be-tight-to-go-the-distance-20200410-p54iux.html,Australia's coronavirus safety net must be tight to go the distance,"Scott Morrison says lines had to be drawn somewhere. The safety net his government created across eight frenzied days of policy making last month had to leave some workers out. The explanation he gave on Tuesday, at the special sitting of Parliament to pass the government’s historic wages subsidy, underlines the difficulty of designing new payment systems from scratch to cope with a once-in-a-century health crisis. Morrison would not wish for any job to be sacrificed. Yet the signal he sends to employers is that there are two classes of casual workers.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The Prime Minister didn’t put it quite this way, because he is not one to admit regret, let alone fault. But the truth is he didn’t have enough time to ensure that all casual workers could be treated equally. The line he drew was at 12 months. Any casual worker who spent at least a year with their current employer would be eligible for the $1500 a fortnight wage subsidy. Those with fewer than 12 months will have to settle for a generous dole payment of $1117.50 per fortnight if they lose their job. Morrison said 12 months was ""a status that is already recognised under Australia's taxation system"". That is, the Australian Taxation Office can’t get the money to all casual workers at the moment, even if the government wanted it to. It is an administrative distinction that would not pass the pub test that politicians are fond of citing in other circumstances. Why should a casual teacher, or sub-contractor in the building trade with many years of continuous work across multiple employers, have fewer rights than a casual worker who has just completed a year in their first job at a pub? Morrison obviously doesn’t see one line of work as more worthy of protecting than the other. But he will need to come up with a better argument than the deflection he used at question time on Tuesday. ""We put the JobSeeker payment and its increased capacity in place because we knew there would be those who would not be ultimately eligible for other measures we may consider,"" he said.
