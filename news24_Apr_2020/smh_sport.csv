A day after describing the NRL’s May resumption plan as ‘‘premature’’, free-to-air broadcast partner Nine softened its stance and will now support the proposed date, avoiding a potential courtroom showdown. It is likely the season will run for about 17 weeks, plus four weeks of finals and an Origin series after a potential October 4 grand final, although that is yet to be confirmed.

The meeting was a very positive one and we now have a starting date, but the length of the season will be confirmed next week.’’ It’s understood Nine wants clarity around the Twenty20 Cricket World Cup, and the potential postponement of the tournament scheduled to be played in Australia in October and November, before finalising the length of the season. Cricket Australia boss Kevin Roberts, however, has indicated an answer may not be given until August. Nine chief Hugh Marks spoke with V’landys after the statement criticising the May restart date blindsided the ARLC chairman on Thursday night, and wrote to him again on Friday before the meeting. Marks’ tone was far more conciliatory than Nine's recent public announcements. The NRL perceived Nine’s comments as a negotiating tactic in discussions about a potential three-year extension. Replay   A frustrated V’landys set the scene for the day ahead on Friday morning when he fronted Karl Stefanovic on Nine’s Today Show and labelled the comments as alarmist rhetoric and scaremongering. He declared Friday was ‘‘D-Day’’. He then summoned interim NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo to Racing NSW’s Druitt Street office in Sydney’s CBD for a three-hour meeting to map out a schedule that would pacify the contrasting desires of both broadcasters. Marks arrived 15 minutes early. Foxtel boss Patrick Delany, driving his silver Mercedes, turned up at 3pm sharp. Nine walked into the meeting wanting to play just another 13 rounds, enough for every team to face each other once.

Nine’s comments had clearly angered the chairman, who until then had been playing nice with the free-to-air network in the hope of finding common ground. Suddenly the gloves were off. What began as a negotiation on Friday turned into an ultimatum. Nine had argued that the NRL was in breach of contract when it pulled the pin on the season in March, because no one had forced it to postpone it. It’s why the NRL took great interest in its statement on Thursday regarding the health and safety standards of the community. But neither party wanted this to turn into a legal battle, but that’s exactly what could have happened had Nine walked from yesterday’s meeting unwilling to commit.

2,/sport/rugby-union/the-final-betrayal-that-caused-castle-to-crumble-20200424-p54n2u.html,The final betrayal that caused Castle to crumble,"Sometime on Thursday morning Raelene Castle called her chairman, Paul McLean. The pair had made hundreds of phone calls to each other in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic threatened the future of Australian rugby. But this one was different. Castle, at this stage still the Rugby Australia chief executive, was taping a pre-recorded interview with the ABC's current affairs flagship, 7.30, that afternoon. Replay   She wanted to know if there was anything coming down the pipeline at her before she went on national television to present a united front for the riven code. As McLean explained in detail on Friday, ""all [Castle] ever wanted was to know that the board supported her and whilst that was the case she would run through broken glass to get things done"".  She asked that if, at any stage they believed the game was better off with someone else at the helm, that they be open and upfront about it. The answer from McLean on Thursday morning was 'no'. What the respected former Wallabies captain meant was 'nothing in the next 48 hours'. What is now clear, acknowledge by McLean and confirmed by another board source, was that the interim chairman and the seven other non-executive directors – Phil Waugh, Pip Marlow, Hayden Rorke, John Wilson, Daniel Herbert, Peter Wiggs and Brett Godfrey – had decided it was time to move on Castle during a conference call the night before. But Castle, satisfied with her chairman's reassurance the next morning, recorded the interview at Rugby Australia's Moore Park headquarters, wrapping up at about 4.15pm on Thursday, in the belief she had the board's backing. She spoke to presenter Leigh Sales about the damaging letter signed by 10 Wallabies captains, calling for sweeping change, that had dropped on Monday night and eclipsed RA's closing of a time-buying pay deal with the game's 192 professional players. Rugby Australia chairman Paul McLean. She deflected a question about the relentless criticism levelled at her over her gender, nationality and appearance, chalking it up to the rough and tumble of sports administration. And she spoke, somewhat elegiacally, about the impending arrival of new Wallabies coach Dave Rennie: ""He will come here regardless of where I sit but I would certainly like the opportunity to work with him because together I think we can deliver some really great outcomes."" Castle will not get that chance. She finished the interview and was confronted by a raft of media enquiries, to her directly and to RA's corporate affairs boss Michael Earsman, asking whether she was aware of the board's intention to sack her within the next week. She was not, the message came back to the Herald, and was not aware the non-executive directors had met on Wednesday night. Alarm bells rang at 5pm when Castle did not join an important conference call with the Super Rugby chairmen, Wiggs and chief financial officer Simon Rabbitt, that had been called to give the states their first look at RA's 2019 financials and cash position and forecasts. No one could explain her absence. She was on the phone to McLean again, asking him to explain whether the media knew something she didn't. This time, the chairman levelled with her. Wednesday night's call had resolved that it was time for fresh leadership, but had not finalised a time frame to make that happen and, crucially, did not have a plan for who would take her place. They were planning to talk to Castle early next week to let her know their thinking. Castle, hurt that the board had allowed her to record the ABC interview – it ended up going to air with a preamble including the chief executive's resignation statement – wanted to take control. She told McLean she was resigning. ""In the last couple of hours it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need,"" she said in a statement. ""The game is bigger than any one individual – so this evening I told the chair that I would resign from the role. I will do whatever is needed to ensure an orderly handover."" The source told the Herald that most of the directors wanted it noted that the Wallabies captains' letter had nothing to do with their decision to move on Castle. But, with the RUPA pay deal locked away, securing more than $12 million in savings on player wages over the next two quarters, and a World Rugby loan application all but granted, it was felt the organisation could start looking beyond September and to what a rebuild might look like. As McLean said on Friday morning: ""...in a normal circumstance without the things that happened in the last two years and some of the unwarranted criticisms and bullying, I think it might have been a different scenario. At the end of the day the board has to make a decision about how the game can progress and if there was a clearer pathway to doing that, we needed to take that pathway because we represent and manage the whole of the game."" The ""last two years"" was likely a reference to the Israel Folau saga, which broke three months into Castle's time at Moore Park and all but swallowed up the game for much of the next 18 months. Raelene Castle at the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne in December.Credit:AAP There was also a feeling that the virus outbreak and the ensuing shutdown presented the board with an opportunity to reshape the structure of the game in Australia, from competitions to governance. Castle's admirable determination to take all the bullets fired at the organisation over the past two years had left her irreparably damaged, they felt. It was time to find a replacement. It was only a pity they did not save Castle from one last humiliation, finding out from the media her days were numbered.

Cricket Australia says big hits will keep coming,"The nation was on the brink of COVID lockdown, Australia having just played New Zealand before a deserted SCG, when Cricket Australia realised it might go broke. On March 19, chief executive Kevin Roberts canvassed the possibility to stunned board members that the game could run out of money by the end of August. His language was measured but, to experienced corporate directors dialled into the Microsoft Teams conference call, the implications were clear. David Warner and Aaron Finch marched on to an empty SCG to take on New Zealand in early March.Credit:AAP Without an urgent financial overhaul, cricket’s national governing body risked trading while insolvent. At a glance, Cricket Australia’s balance sheet appeared healthy. With its broadcast partners having deposited the latest instalment of a six-year, $1.8 billion rights deal, it had nearly $100 million squirrelled away for the winter. Yet, as Roberts mapped the outgoings, the mounting pressure on its broadcast and corporate partners and the impact of the sharemarket crash on Cricket Australia’s investment fund, his projections showed that the dollars could disappear quicker than a legside full toss. “It was certainly plausible that our cash and investments could track down to zero at the end of August, absolutely,’’ Roberts says. “Which is why we’ve had to take the action that we have.’’ Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts.Credit:Getty Images Not everyone in cricket is convinced. Two of the game's most influential stakeholders, the professional players and state associations, are sceptical about the depth of the financial crisis and the explanations given so far by Cricket Australia. They have asked to see more detailed financial information before they agree to Cricket Australia’s proposal to cut player payments and grants to the states by a quarter. Roberts warns the game must prepare for a “new normal” after the pandemic with significantly reduced revenue. At a minimum, Cricket Australia is seeking to cut 25 per cent from its operating costs and for the states and players to accept a proportionate cut. It is also planning for things to get a lot worse. Replay   “What we have done is to make sure we have a plan for cricket to withstand a 50 per cent reduction in revenue if we need it to,’’ he tells The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. “It is not suggesting things will get to that point but it is ensuring we don’t retrospectively find that we haven’t planned appropriately for what we could be facing in the following financial year. “Part of this was dealing with issues that have occurred already and part of it is making sure that cricket can withstand the issues that may come at us next season.” This Rumsfeldian mix of known and unknowns has made for a muddled explanation as to how a game so flush with cash could get to this point. As the chief executive of one corporate partner put it, “the numbers don’t stack up”. Within Cricket Australia there is acknowledgment that even without the pandemic the organisation’s cashflow would have cut uncomfortably close to the bone this winter. A game which generated total revenue of $486 million in FY 2019 was predicted to get down to its last $40 million. This wild fluctuation in cash flow, although a product of the vagaries of the international touring schedule, the disparate drawing power of England and India compared with other nations and the seasonal nature of cricket revenue, prompted Cricket Australia before the COVID crisis to consider a capital working facility – a secure line of credit from a bank – to better manage its financial peaks and troughs. “It is evident that in addition to holding reserves we need an ongoing, working capital facility to buffer against the significant ups and downs,’’ Roberts says. When Roberts added in the potential impact of the pandemic, the board backed his decision to bring in an experienced corporate toe-cutter Paul Reining, to take charge of finances at Jolimont. The Cricket Australia crisis management team comprises Reining, who previously helped Roberts restructure the financially stricken sports apparel company 2XU, chief operating officer Scott Grant, CA chairman Earl Eddings and board members Paul Green and Michelle Tredenick. Eddings is the managing director of a risk management company, Green a KPMG partner and Tredenick a board member of the Insurance Australia Group and Bank of Queensland. Cricket Australia’s long-serving chief financial officer Todd Shand, having resigned in January, agreed to stay on to help weather the crisis. There are four parts to cricket’s plan for financial survival; to secure a working capital facility, to cut the organisation’s operating expenses, to reduce grants to the states and to reach agreement with the players’ union for an “amended player payment model.” The most dramatic step taken so far is Cricket Australia’s decision to stand down until June 30 about 80 per cent of its staff. Cricket Australia has registered for the federal government JobKeeper scheme but is uncertain whether it will apply. It will pay affected staff either 20 per cent of their wages or the JobKeeper amount of $1500 a fortnight, depending which is higher. Roberts and his executive team have accepted a 20 per cent pay cut and a waiving of all performance bonuses for this financial year. Roberts says the mass standing down will preserve about $3 million of expenses but the decision is less about saving money than spending it responsibly. COVID restrictions means that, for many Cricket Australia staff, there is simply not enough work to do. Roberts said that Cricket Australia, a not-for-profit organisation, can’t keep paying people full time salaries to not work. “People wouldn’t have been engaged in many cases at all and in some cases, part time, in the normal activities that would happen in this period of the year. We’ve had two tours cancelled. We have various training programs cancelled and other activities cancelled. That is what led us to this particular point.” Roberts is less clear on why the COVID lockdown, an episode which began after Cricket Australia had staged all but one of last summer's international matches, triggered a financial crisis within the game. According to Roberts, the net impact of the pandemic so far is a $20 million reduction in Cricket Australia’s cash and investment reserves. The grounding of international and interstate travel, including a women’s tour to South Africa and men’s tour to Bangladesh, has saved CA about $20 million. This means that, since March, the pandemic has stripped in the order of $40 million from CA’s accounts. Where has the money gone? There was a loss caused by the cancelled one day international against New Zealand and Cricket Australia has needed to find more money to bankroll the operations of its T20 World Cup organising committee, which must keep preparing for the possibility of a tournament this summer but can't raise funds through ticket sales or events. Roberts says the largest single loss to Cricket Australia, about $10 million, is from a sharp depreciation of its investment fund since February. However, that loss will only be realised if Cricket Australia is forced to sell its shares. Roberts remains hopeful that it won’t. The final, COVID-related hit to Cricket Australia’s finances nominated by Roberts is “bad debtors”; the prospect of corporate partners and other debtors being unable to meet their payments. Cricket sources say the assumed loss from bad debtors is estimated to be close to $20 million. Roberts is unwilling to disclose the details of Cricket Australia’s sponsorship arrangements but says the full impact of the pandemic on the sports market is still to be felt. India are due to tour again this summer - but possibly to empty grounds.Credit:Scott Barbour “What has been incurred thus far is not the lion’s share of it. We are obviously anticipating an ongoing impact, like many organisations, in terms of our debtors. We are looking at the current trends and anticipating what that means in the current months.” This is the looming, billion-dollar question for cricket and other professional sports. India is due to tour this summer but if they come, they will almost certainly play before empty stadiums. The last time India played a Test series here, nearly half a million people walked through the turnstiles. The difference to Cricket Australia is about $50 million. The difference to sponsors and broadcasters is potentially of even greater significance. Chip Le Grand is The Age’s chief reporter.

Roberts is unwilling to disclose the details of Cricket Australia’s sponsorship arrangements but says the full impact of the pandemic on the sports market is still to be felt. India are due to tour again this summer - but possibly to empty grounds.Credit:Scott Barbour “What has been incurred thus far is not the lion’s share of it. We are obviously anticipating an ongoing impact, like many organisations, in terms of our debtors. We are looking at the current trends and anticipating what that means in the current months.” This is the looming, billion-dollar question for cricket and other professional sports. India is due to tour this summer but if they come, they will almost certainly play before empty stadiums. The last time India played a Test series here, nearly half a million people walked through the turnstiles. The difference to Cricket Australia is about $50 million. The difference to sponsors and broadcasters is potentially of even greater significance. Chip Le Grand is The Age’s chief reporter.

Kerlies Sportzfan was an ode to his love of basketball and the NBA, which at the time occupied a small niche in the mostly inward-looking Australian sporting mindset. It was a mission for the 1972 Olympian, who would win four NBL crowns as a head coach, just to stock the store. He would travel to the US and bring merchandise back in his suitcase, then ask any friends on holidays or business to do the same. Replay   When it did hit the shelves, it was hardly flying out the door. His store was more of an oasis for dedicated basketball heads who would salivate over the silky moves of James Worthy or Larry Bird's automatic mid-range jumper. Then the tidal wave already sweeping the NBA crashed into the other side of the Pacific. The infiltration was more measured in reality but, at the time, it felt the NBA was a curiosity one day, a mainstream indulgence the next. ""It just exploded. Sometimes, I was selling 100 Bulls singlets and 100 Bulls shorts and 20-30 Bulls caps a day in the school holidays,"" Kerle says. ""I couldn’t keep up the demand. It was phenomenal, it was incredible. But it was all Jordan. There was Magic (Johnson) and Larry, that helped, but Jordan, that was a phenomenon. Kids loved him. It seemed like five out of 10 kids were wearing Bulls gear at one point."" If the first two episodes of the stunning new documentary series The Last Dance, which chronicles the final season of Chicago's six NBA titles in the Jordan era, evoked anything outside of the reminder that he loved winning and was excellent at basketball, it was a nostalgic refresher of the sheer force with which Jordan's celebrity devoured global sports culture. Australia was a particularly receptive market. In an era with minimal local TV exposure, no internet or social media, Jordan was the centre of a relentless branding machine powered by Nike that supercharged basketball's popularity and made His Airness the world's most famous athlete. ""Anything with his logo or name, that would fly out the door,"" Kerle said. ""It was great times … it really was. It was everything Chicago Bulls. Videos, posters … anything. You could put it on a postage stamp or a gum leaf and I would have been able to sell it. ""He had a tremendous impact on the game. He’s not the only one but he’s the most important figure in the history of the sport. Nobody will ever emulate what Jordan did for the game."" Locally, the basketball scene and the NBL was already enjoying an upsurge in popularity when the Bulls were hurtling towards their first championship in 1990-91.

8,/sport/why-it-s-high-time-gladys-put-the-nrl-in-its-place-20200424-p54n1f.html,Why it's high time Gladys put the NRL in its place,"So many points, so little time! As this goes to press the NRL is still resolute on restarting the comp on May 28 even as every other industry involving close contact is shut down. They will, we are assured, wash their hands both before and afterwards. Replay   And look, don’t you worry, rugby league players have a long history of sticking to the rules, and are famous for always taking sensible precautions against misadventure. Hey, I got a million of them! But seriously, folks. Essentially, the NRL chair Peter V’landys is arguing the case of rugby league exceptionalism, that the social isolation rules that apply to everyone else should not apply to them. AFL has much less contact than NRL and even they can’t contemplate coming back before July. In response to the NRL's insistence, however, both the Queensland and Victorian premiers have been clear: “Not on your Nelly.” With commendable leadership they have dismissed it out of hand and Channel Nine – a little late in the piece and maybe for not entirely the same reasons – is also not convinced. Who is missing right now is the NSW government. I think. For I cannot follow it. I believe we had, yes, the Police Commissioner signing a letter saying it was OK? Or maybe that was the Health Minister signing a letter giving a big tick to the police force? The point is, where are you, Premier Gladys? Does this get the go-ahead, or not? Are some people going to be still banned from seeing Grandma through anything bar a centimetre of glass, while others are not allowed to even attend the funerals of their nearest and dearest, but . . . But it is OK for the rugby league lads to wrestle sweat and burst breath all over each other for five or six days a week, before they go home to their families? Is that your position? If so, I respectfully ask: What is your own case for rugby league exceptionalism? Rugby league returning on May 28 is 'absolute madness', says Peter FitzSimons.Credit:AAP If it is good enough for them, why is it not good enough for the rest of us? Personally, this seems to me to be absolute madness, Premier. If you are going to open things up, so be it. But giving the green light to rugby league while the rest of us will have been stuck on red at the traffic lights for the past two months seems to be taking an insane and unnecessary risk. Essentially, the NRL chair Peter V’landys is arguing the case of rugby league exceptionalism, that the social isolation rules that apply to everyone else should not apply to them.Credit:John Shakespeare With the admittedly huge exception of the Ruby Princess, your government has done well on coronavirus. But are you really going to be forcing the resignation of your own Minister, Don Harwin, and nailing a $1000 fine to his head, just for going to his own holiday home on the Central Coast – you negligent bastard, how dare you!? – while saying that from late next week the leaguies are good to start training? We know rugby league has sway in this town, but does it have that much sway? That would be like saying proper resources for community and kids sport can get nicked, while we put billions of dollars to stadiums for rugby league and . . . And, oh, wait! Gladys, it is a nonsense, and you must know it. If you give the green light to league, you must give the green light to us all. If that is the case, can we all be told, too? At the very least you, and the NRL, have to make a compelling case for rugby league exceptionalism. Right now, it ain’t obvious. In the wake of Nick Farr-Jones and me firing shots from opposite sides of the rugby parapet this week, I have been bemused by several people wondering how we are going as friends? The answer is – notwithstanding a few tight, taut texts – fine! The position remains, either he will carry my coffin, or I will carry his. We have disagreed many on things for exactly 40 years, this year, and if this disagreement is stronger than most, so be it. I strongly disagree with his contention that Raelene Castle pulled the wrong rein on Israel Folau, as it obvious to me and most that in the face of that conflagration she and the board had no choice but to react the way they did. I have no clue specifically what the 10 Wallaby captains want the new board and new CEO to do that the old board and former CEO weren’t doing, beyond the motherhood blandishments contained in the letter. And I equally think that the optics of the 11 captains – Michael Lynagh later withdrew his signature – signing the letter 24 hours before Ms Castle was harassed from office were terrible. Whoever takes over from Castle – Farr-Jones is publically pushing hard for Phil Kearns – will have an enormous job ahead to bring the rugby community back together and convince the mob that it is not a case of the boys from Boys Club breaking the door down and charging in so they can be put back in charge. But against all that, I equally accept that the collective motivation of the signatories of the letter was only for the good of rugby. Farr-Jones personally remains the greatest and longest-standing servant of the game in Australia and has my deep respect for that, among many things. In short, rugby supporters, stay tuned. We will be back, after this brief brawl. The biography Anna Meares: Now came out this week, and there are some cracker yarns in it. It was a few weeks out from the 2012 London Olympics see, and our greatest ever track cyclist was about to take on not just Great Britain’s world champion, Victoria Pendleton, aka ‘Queen Victoria’, but her parochial British fans as well. It is daunting, but her coach Nick Flyger has an idea. Why not approach John Eales, who is working with the Australian Olympic team as an athlete liaison officer … Anna Meares at the London 2012 Olympic Games.Credit:Brendan Esposito “He has faced the New Zealand haka,” says Flyger. “If you’re going to face Victoria Pendleton in front of her home crowd, then you need to take some gold from him.” It is all arranged. “So, John, what was your secret?” Anna asks. Eales explains. It’s all about the set-up. Let them do their haka, their explosions of joy and rage and all the rest. But . . . But then sort yourself to have enough time between the finish of the haka, and the start of the match. In the case of the Wallabies it was wearing the track-suits for the haka, and then taking your time taking them off and lining up for the kick-off. In your case, Anna, you’ll work it out. Done. For the gold medal race at the velodrome in London, where the crowd noise reached levels akin to that of a jet plane, Pendleton is first on the track. Where is Anna? She and her coach are still on the edge of track, discussing tactics. By the time they reach the start, the crowd has gone quiet. Queen Victoria looks nervous. Anna charges to a famous victory. A happy ending? Yes, and it gets happier still. She and Nick Flyger are now a couple and in February welcomed their first child, a daughter named Evelyn. Raelene Castle resigns as CEO of Rugby Australia: “In the last couple of hours, it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need. The game is bigger than any one individual — so this evening I told the chair [Paul McLean] that I would resign from the role.” Todd Greenberg: “It has been my great honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last 4 years. Despite the variety of challenges and pressures I have loved every single minute of the journey. Our growth over the last 4 years has been extraordinary and I am very proud of my contribution to the game.”  @Steele_sports comments on Twitter, as the second CEO of a major football code bites the dust in three days: “First Covid-19 now the sequel CEO-2.” @marty_McFly_01: “No live action so league and union engage in a foot-shooting contest.” I think rugby union is just ahead at the moment, but it may have to come down to golden point. Who shoots the last little toe off first, wins. Excerpt from the letter signed by a slew of Wallaby captains and sent to incumbent chair Paul McLean: “In recent times, the Australian game has lost its way. It is a defeat inflicted not by COVID-19, or an on-field foe, but rather by poor administration and leadership over a number of years. We speak as one voice when we say Australian rugby needs new vision, leadership and a plan for the future. That plan must involve, as a priority, urgent steps to create a much-needed, sustainable, commercial rugby business.” Michael Lynagh withdrew his name the next morning. Tony Shaw, himself a distinguished Wallaby captain, on the letter signed by his brethren: “I'm gobsmacked. Why put it in the public domain when you have a chairman, who was a captain, just like you, who's done every job in rugby known to man – from player, captain, coach, administrator and president – and worked his butt off to work through the pandemic fallout in a short time frame?” Peter V’Landys won’t replace Greenberg with himself: “I’ve made that clear that I won’t do it. I’m not interested in it and I’ve never been interested in doing it. I don’t think it’s appropriate: there needs to be a segregation between the board and management. I’ve always believed in proper corporate governance, so it would be hypocritical to do anything other than that.” A Nine spokesperson on the NRL’s intended restart on May 28: “Although we agree constructive discussions have been held between the NRL, Nine and Foxtel, we feel it's premature to be confirming a start date at this stage.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in response to the NRL’s claim that the governments have signed off on the plan to restart the comp: “There is no detailed plan. I call on the NRL to submit that detailed plan and I will immediately forward it to [Queensland Chief Health Officer] Dr Young for her consideration and to report back to me.” Marty McFly, one of the Twitterati: “So a couple of hundred players, staff, broadcasting types and assorted hangers on can gather for a game of league but only a handful of my mates can see me off if I drop dead tomorrow? Working man’s game?” Cricket umpire Ian Gould on Australian cricket eventually crossing the line: “I believe Australia were out of control leading up to the ball-tampering issues. Deep down, we [umpires] let them down in that we should have nailed them three years previously but we let it go, let it go, let it go and it just exploded.” Australian cyclist Rohan Dennis on social media. He later deleted his accounts: “Day 34 - cracked and left the house. #covid19 can suck my ass and so can #quarantine.” I protest. Among other things, in Australia, it is spelt “arse.” Arsenal supporter Aaron Hughes on Chelsea player Jorginho sending a personal message to his girlfriend: “He’s Chelsea’s vice-captain and gives off this family-man image and there he is sending texts to my girlfriend. What sort of example is that? What made it even worse, as an Arsenal fan, was to see him score against us in December. They ended up winning. That just added to my pain.” Collingwood football star Mason Cox, an American, after watching a protester against isolation in his homeland proclaim, “What do I say to the science? I say I don’t believe your science, because I believe my God.” “Well after seeing that I don’t know that I’m ever going to leave Australia again. US, it’s been real but I’m out.” Todd Greenberg. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Raelene Castle. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Peter V’Landys. His psychological grip on the denizens of rugby league seems to have strengthened in recent weeks. Odd that a bloke unknown to the broad mass of the league community – at least as a football figure – until a couple of years ago should now be the one laying down the law and cracking the whip even to people who’ve been in the game for 40 years! Liverpool. Never do things the easy way. Without Corona, they would have, I’m told, won the league a long time ago. Peter FitzSimons is a journalist and columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald.

In the case of the Wallabies it was wearing the track-suits for the haka, and then taking your time taking them off and lining up for the kick-off. In your case, Anna, you’ll work it out. Done. For the gold medal race at the velodrome in London, where the crowd noise reached levels akin to that of a jet plane, Pendleton is first on the track. Where is Anna? She and her coach are still on the edge of track, discussing tactics. By the time they reach the start, the crowd has gone quiet. Queen Victoria looks nervous. Anna charges to a famous victory. A happy ending? Yes, and it gets happier still. She and Nick Flyger are now a couple and in February welcomed their first child, a daughter named Evelyn. Raelene Castle resigns as CEO of Rugby Australia: “In the last couple of hours, it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need. The game is bigger than any one individual — so this evening I told the chair [Paul McLean] that I would resign from the role.” Todd Greenberg: “It has been my great honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last 4 years. Despite the variety of challenges and pressures I have loved every single minute of the journey. Our growth over the last 4 years has been extraordinary and I am very proud of my contribution to the game.”  @Steele_sports comments on Twitter, as the second CEO of a major football code bites the dust in three days: “First Covid-19 now the sequel CEO-2.” @marty_McFly_01: “No live action so league and union engage in a foot-shooting contest.” I think rugby union is just ahead at the moment, but it may have to come down to golden point. Who shoots the last little toe off first, wins. Excerpt from the letter signed by a slew of Wallaby captains and sent to incumbent chair Paul McLean: “In recent times, the Australian game has lost its way. It is a defeat inflicted not by COVID-19, or an on-field foe, but rather by poor administration and leadership over a number of years. We speak as one voice when we say Australian rugby needs new vision, leadership and a plan for the future. That plan must involve, as a priority, urgent steps to create a much-needed, sustainable, commercial rugby business.” Michael Lynagh withdrew his name the next morning. Tony Shaw, himself a distinguished Wallaby captain, on the letter signed by his brethren: “I'm gobsmacked. Why put it in the public domain when you have a chairman, who was a captain, just like you, who's done every job in rugby known to man – from player, captain, coach, administrator and president – and worked his butt off to work through the pandemic fallout in a short time frame?” Peter V’Landys won’t replace Greenberg with himself: “I’ve made that clear that I won’t do it. I’m not interested in it and I’ve never been interested in doing it. I don’t think it’s appropriate: there needs to be a segregation between the board and management. I’ve always believed in proper corporate governance, so it would be hypocritical to do anything other than that.” A Nine spokesperson on the NRL’s intended restart on May 28: “Although we agree constructive discussions have been held between the NRL, Nine and Foxtel, we feel it's premature to be confirming a start date at this stage.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in response to the NRL’s claim that the governments have signed off on the plan to restart the comp: “There is no detailed plan. I call on the NRL to submit that detailed plan and I will immediately forward it to [Queensland Chief Health Officer] Dr Young for her consideration and to report back to me.” Marty McFly, one of the Twitterati: “So a couple of hundred players, staff, broadcasting types and assorted hangers on can gather for a game of league but only a handful of my mates can see me off if I drop dead tomorrow? Working man’s game?” Cricket umpire Ian Gould on Australian cricket eventually crossing the line: “I believe Australia were out of control leading up to the ball-tampering issues. Deep down, we [umpires] let them down in that we should have nailed them three years previously but we let it go, let it go, let it go and it just exploded.” Australian cyclist Rohan Dennis on social media. He later deleted his accounts: “Day 34 - cracked and left the house. #covid19 can suck my ass and so can #quarantine.” I protest. Among other things, in Australia, it is spelt “arse.” Arsenal supporter Aaron Hughes on Chelsea player Jorginho sending a personal message to his girlfriend: “He’s Chelsea’s vice-captain and gives off this family-man image and there he is sending texts to my girlfriend. What sort of example is that? What made it even worse, as an Arsenal fan, was to see him score against us in December. They ended up winning. That just added to my pain.” Collingwood football star Mason Cox, an American, after watching a protester against isolation in his homeland proclaim, “What do I say to the science? I say I don’t believe your science, because I believe my God.” “Well after seeing that I don’t know that I’m ever going to leave Australia again. US, it’s been real but I’m out.” Todd Greenberg. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Raelene Castle. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Peter V’Landys. His psychological grip on the denizens of rugby league seems to have strengthened in recent weeks. Odd that a bloke unknown to the broad mass of the league community – at least as a football figure – until a couple of years ago should now be the one laying down the law and cracking the whip even to people who’ve been in the game for 40 years! Liverpool. Never do things the easy way. Without Corona, they would have, I’m told, won the league a long time ago. Peter FitzSimons is a journalist and columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald.

16,/sport/nrl/football-is-not-an-essential-service-experts-divided-on-nrl-return-20200423-p54mnw.html,'Football is not an essential service': Experts divided on NRL return,"Infectious diseases experts are divided over the NRL’s plans to restart the competition on May 28, with a leading authority branding the target date ""premature"" in the current environment because ""football is not an essential service"". The development comes as Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said there would be an expectation that sporting codes would need the national cabinet to sign off on their return. The Project Apollo taskforce is putting the finishing touches on a 50-page document outlining the code’s biosecurity measures before disseminating it to clubs on Friday for their feedback. The protocols will then be submitted to federal and state governments to address any concerns they may have about a resumption of play. Replay   The NRL believes the measures will ensure the players will be subject to safety standards more stringent than the rest of society, despite the fact they will be colliding with each other in one of the planet’s most brutal contact sports. However, some experts remain sceptical. Associate Professor Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney, labelled the NRL’s restart date ""presumptuous"" and said it was sending the wrong message to the rest of society. ""I understand the business imperative and there is an element as well where it is important for social and mental wellbeing for people to feel a sense of normalcy as much as possible,"" Kamradt-Scott said. ""But the reality is any arbitrary date at the moment is arbitrary. We have seen in other countries that have relaxed measures too early that it has resulted in countries reasserting strict social-distancing measures. ""This is always the challenge with disease outbreaks – as you see the numbers go down, people start to think the crisis is over and we can go back to normal. But the reality is that if it’s done too early, we become back in the midst of it as well. ""What we need people to do – and this includes organisations such as the NRL – is to stay the course. ""We need them to continue to behave responsibly so we can get the country back on its feet sooner rather than later. But if they jump the gun and restart things too early we will confront the situation where we will see cases rise again and us having to go back into stronger restrictions. The experts are divided over the restart of the NRL season on May 28.Credit:Getty ""The most immediate example of that at the moment was Singapore, which was praised early in the pandemic for its rapid control and suppression of the virus, but now they are recording cases in the hundreds again. ""That is a clear example of what can happen if the measures are lifted too early ... I’m concerned about the message [the NRL restarting] sends to the rest of the community. Football is not an essential service."" Murphy said the NRL had not sought permission from the country's top health emergency body about restarting. ""I would be hopeful that decisions around starting codes would have national cabinet approval, because there's more than one sporting code,"" Murphy told a senate inquiry into the government's response to the pandemic. ""The federal government and the Minister for Sport's office are obviously in ongoing discussions with the NRL. There hasn't been a formal process of seeking approval from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, to my knowledge. We haven't been asked for formal advice at this stage."" Australian Rugby League Commission director Wayne Pearce, who is heading up Project Apollo, said on Wednesday the third round of the premiership would ""definitely"" resume on May 28. The NSW government's position hasn’t changed since Pearce’s comments, with formal approval yet to be granted. ""The public health orders do not prohibit the NRL from re-starting its season,"" a NSW government spokesman said. ""It’s up to individual organisations to ensure they comply with the health rules, and operate within them. ""The NRL has sought its own health advice and whether the NRL or any sport can safely restart its season within the current health advice is a matter for them."" The Herald is seeking comment from the office of Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt. Are NRL stars such as Blake Ferguson returning to the field too soon?Credit:NRL Photos Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was scheduled to speak to ARLC chairman Peter V’landys on Thursday. In an interview on 2GB, Dutton said he was supportive of an NRL restart, although he acknowledged the Warriors would need an exemption from Australian Border Force to participate. He added that he was seeking clarity from the Queensland government about its border controls. ""Getting the NRL up and started is an important part of the next steps that we take to normalise and return back to life the way we knew it only a few months ago,"" Dutton told The Ray Hadley Morning Show.

17,/sport/nrl/football-is-not-an-essential-service-experts-divided-on-nrl-return-20200423-p54mnw.html,'Football is not an essential service': Experts divided on NRL return,"Infectious diseases experts are divided over the NRL’s plans to restart the competition on May 28, with a leading authority branding the target date ""premature"" in the current environment because ""football is not an essential service"". The development comes as Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said there would be an expectation that sporting codes would need the national cabinet to sign off on their return. The Project Apollo taskforce is putting the finishing touches on a 50-page document outlining the code’s biosecurity measures before disseminating it to clubs on Friday for their feedback. The protocols will then be submitted to federal and state governments to address any concerns they may have about a resumption of play. Replay   The NRL believes the measures will ensure the players will be subject to safety standards more stringent than the rest of society, despite the fact they will be colliding with each other in one of the planet’s most brutal contact sports. However, some experts remain sceptical. Associate Professor Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney, labelled the NRL’s restart date ""presumptuous"" and said it was sending the wrong message to the rest of society. ""I understand the business imperative and there is an element as well where it is important for social and mental wellbeing for people to feel a sense of normalcy as much as possible,"" Kamradt-Scott said. ""But the reality is any arbitrary date at the moment is arbitrary. We have seen in other countries that have relaxed measures too early that it has resulted in countries reasserting strict social-distancing measures. ""This is always the challenge with disease outbreaks – as you see the numbers go down, people start to think the crisis is over and we can go back to normal. But the reality is that if it’s done too early, we become back in the midst of it as well. ""What we need people to do – and this includes organisations such as the NRL – is to stay the course. ""We need them to continue to behave responsibly so we can get the country back on its feet sooner rather than later. But if they jump the gun and restart things too early we will confront the situation where we will see cases rise again and us having to go back into stronger restrictions. The experts are divided over the restart of the NRL season on May 28.Credit:Getty ""The most immediate example of that at the moment was Singapore, which was praised early in the pandemic for its rapid control and suppression of the virus, but now they are recording cases in the hundreds again. ""That is a clear example of what can happen if the measures are lifted too early ... I’m concerned about the message [the NRL restarting] sends to the rest of the community. Football is not an essential service."" Murphy said the NRL had not sought permission from the country's top health emergency body about restarting. ""I would be hopeful that decisions around starting codes would have national cabinet approval, because there's more than one sporting code,"" Murphy told a senate inquiry into the government's response to the pandemic. ""The federal government and the Minister for Sport's office are obviously in ongoing discussions with the NRL. There hasn't been a formal process of seeking approval from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, to my knowledge. We haven't been asked for formal advice at this stage."" Australian Rugby League Commission director Wayne Pearce, who is heading up Project Apollo, said on Wednesday the third round of the premiership would ""definitely"" resume on May 28. The NSW government's position hasn’t changed since Pearce’s comments, with formal approval yet to be granted. ""The public health orders do not prohibit the NRL from re-starting its season,"" a NSW government spokesman said. ""It’s up to individual organisations to ensure they comply with the health rules, and operate within them. ""The NRL has sought its own health advice and whether the NRL or any sport can safely restart its season within the current health advice is a matter for them."" The Herald is seeking comment from the office of Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt. Are NRL stars such as Blake Ferguson returning to the field too soon?Credit:NRL Photos Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was scheduled to speak to ARLC chairman Peter V’landys on Thursday. In an interview on 2GB, Dutton said he was supportive of an NRL restart, although he acknowledged the Warriors would need an exemption from Australian Border Force to participate. He added that he was seeking clarity from the Queensland government about its border controls. ""Getting the NRL up and started is an important part of the next steps that we take to normalise and return back to life the way we knew it only a few months ago,"" Dutton told The Ray Hadley Morning Show.

20,/sport/basketball/it-just-exploded-how-jordan-s-stardom-changed-australia-s-sporting-culture-20200424-p54mvf.html,'It just exploded': How Jordan's stardom changed Australia's sporting culture,"By Phil Lutton In the late 1980s, Brian Kerle opened a small store tucked away under a shopping centre in Brisbane's Queen St Mall. Kerlies Sportzfan was an ode to his love of basketball and the NBA, which at the time occupied a small niche in the mostly inward-looking Australian sporting mindset. It was a mission for the 1972 Olympian, who would win four NBL crowns as a head coach, just to stock the store. He would travel to the US and bring merchandise back in his suitcase, then ask any friends on holidays or business to do the same. Replay   When it did hit the shelves, it was hardly flying out the door. His store was more of an oasis for dedicated basketball heads who would salivate over the silky moves of James Worthy or Larry Bird's automatic mid-range jumper. Then the tidal wave already sweeping the NBA crashed into the other side of the Pacific. The infiltration was more measured in reality but, at the time, it felt the NBA was a curiosity one day, a mainstream indulgence the next. ""It just exploded. Sometimes, I was selling 100 Bulls singlets and 100 Bulls shorts and 20-30 Bulls caps a day in the school holidays,"" Kerle says. ""I couldn’t keep up the demand. It was phenomenal, it was incredible. But it was all Jordan. There was Magic (Johnson) and Larry, that helped, but Jordan, that was a phenomenon. Kids loved him. It seemed like five out of 10 kids were wearing Bulls gear at one point."" If the first two episodes of the stunning new documentary series The Last Dance, which chronicles the final season of Chicago's six NBA titles in the Jordan era, evoked anything outside of the reminder that he loved winning and was excellent at basketball, it was a nostalgic refresher of the sheer force with which Jordan's celebrity devoured global sports culture. Australia was a particularly receptive market. In an era with minimal local TV exposure, no internet or social media, Jordan was the centre of a relentless branding machine powered by Nike that supercharged basketball's popularity and made His Airness the world's most famous athlete. ""Anything with his logo or name, that would fly out the door,"" Kerle said. ""It was great times … it really was. It was everything Chicago Bulls. Videos, posters … anything. You could put it on a postage stamp or a gum leaf and I would have been able to sell it. ""He had a tremendous impact on the game. He’s not the only one but he’s the most important figure in the history of the sport. Nobody will ever emulate what Jordan did for the game."" Locally, the basketball scene and the NBL was already enjoying an upsurge in popularity when the Bulls were hurtling towards their first championship in 1990-91. Malcolm Speed, its then chief executive, remembers those heady times but it's only with hindsight that he fully appreciates the impact of the NBA explosion. Michael Jordan became a global megastar in the early '90s and Australians lapped up anything bearing his brand or number.Credit:AP ""It was an interesting time. It coincided with the NBL taking off in the mid-to-late 80s. It started to get good crowds in both cities. There was already some momentum here and some of that was NBA-driven ... Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. But a good deal was local momentum,"" Speed said. ""Then Jordan came. Kids started appearing with No.23 shirts and, at first, I don’t think we appreciated what sort of boost we were getting from that spike in popularity. We knew it was having an impact but it was hard to distinguish between local and NBA-driven growth. ""Certainly by the time they won their first three-peat, it was a huge phenomenon. That was the first time Australians seemed to become enthusiastic about the NBA in large numbers. ""If you were watching here in the late '80s or early '90s, it was more or less highlights packages on TV. We didn’t have social media, no internet, anything that makes it so easy to follow US sports now. The NBA's popularity helped fuel the profile of domestic stars like Melbourne's Mark Bradke, Andrew Gaze and Lanard Copeland.Credit:Fairfax Photographic ""Perhaps that’s a sign of what a phenomenon it was given the very limited coverage the NBA was getting. Jordan had a cult following in Australia and I remember the shoes coming through … that was massive. Nobody had ever seen a merchandising program built on an athlete like that before. It was amazing."" Sports marketer and founder of Sports Geek, Sean Callanan, said Jordan's brilliance as a basketballer was just one part of the magic potion concocted by the NBA and his sponsors. ""The NBA made some really good moves early on to start internationalising their game. It was a bit of a perfect storm. The NBA is built for celebrities … you see their face all the time, you are close to the action,"" Callanan said. ""At the same time, the San Francisco 49ers were winning and Joe Montana and Jerry Rice were big deals. But they were behind a mask; Jordan was everywhere. Every brand attached themselves to that … Nike, McDonald's, Gatorade. That’s the only drink you wanted to drink after sport if you wanted to Be Like Mike. ""It was a combination of those things and those brands cashing in on him that accelerated basketball overall. And if you look at other pivotal moments, David Stern agreeing to the NBA players taking part in the Barcelona Olympics was massive. Here they were, right before our eyes, and that just seemed to confirm that yep, this was the biggest sport in the world at the time. ""That bumped flowed into Australia. There were people playing basketball but this really converted them into fans that wanted to watch it all the time. You could only see one NBA game a week so then the attention turns to Andrew Gaze and Leroy Loggins … there was a time people were wondering if the NBL could threaten the AFL. That was the talk for a little while."" Every cool kid had a pair of Jordans. And if The Last Dance shows Jordan to be a self-absorbed, absurdly driven athlete who had few issues belittling opponents or even people in his own organisation, then at the time wide-eyed fans only knew the Jordan through the prism of a calculated and groundbreaking branding campaign. ""Jordan kept everyone on side. That was the media landscape. We saw him through TV and the ads. There was no competition for our attention,"" Callanan said. ""Now, as a 15-year-old, you can follow LeBron James and all of these outlets reporting all these different things. Jordan’s team were really good at controlling his image. And everyone lapped it up. ""Others have tried to do that since. Nike, for example, maximised the opportunities through the shoes and the merchandise. So yes, that’s a new model at the time. ""But no athlete since has been able to duplicate that, whether it’s Kobe Bryant or LeBron James. You can’t be the second man on the moon. Jordan is the first and his brand is still bringing in millions."" Sports reporter Copyright © 2020",,

As this goes to press the NRL is still resolute on restarting the comp on May 28 even as every other industry involving close contact is shut down. They will, we are assured, wash their hands both before and afterwards. Replay   And look, don’t you worry, rugby league players have a long history of sticking to the rules, and are famous for always taking sensible precautions against misadventure. Hey, I got a million of them! But seriously, folks. Essentially, the NRL chair Peter V’landys is arguing the case of rugby league exceptionalism, that the social isolation rules that apply to everyone else should not apply to them. AFL has much less contact than NRL and even they can’t contemplate coming back before July. In response to the NRL's insistence, however, both the Queensland and Victorian premiers have been clear: “Not on your Nelly.” With commendable leadership they have dismissed it out of hand and Channel Nine – a little late in the piece and maybe for not entirely the same reasons – is also not convinced. Who is missing right now is the NSW government. I think. For I cannot follow it. I believe we had, yes, the Police Commissioner signing a letter saying it was OK? Or maybe that was the Health Minister signing a letter giving a big tick to the police force? The point is, where are you, Premier Gladys? Does this get the go-ahead, or not? Are some people going to be still banned from seeing Grandma through anything bar a centimetre of glass, while others are not allowed to even attend the funerals of their nearest and dearest, but . . . But it is OK for the rugby league lads to wrestle sweat and burst breath all over each other for five or six days a week, before they go home to their families? Is that your position? If so, I respectfully ask: What is your own case for rugby league exceptionalism? Rugby league returning on May 28 is 'absolute madness', says Peter FitzSimons.Credit:AAP If it is good enough for them, why is it not good enough for the rest of us? Personally, this seems to me to be absolute madness, Premier. If you are going to open things up, so be it. But giving the green light to rugby league while the rest of us will have been stuck on red at the traffic lights for the past two months seems to be taking an insane and unnecessary risk. Essentially, the NRL chair Peter V’landys is arguing the case of rugby league exceptionalism, that the social isolation rules that apply to everyone else should not apply to them.Credit:John Shakespeare With the admittedly huge exception of the Ruby Princess, your government has done well on coronavirus. But are you really going to be forcing the resignation of your own Minister, Don Harwin, and nailing a $1000 fine to his head, just for going to his own holiday home on the Central Coast – you negligent bastard, how dare you!? – while saying that from late next week the leaguies are good to start training? We know rugby league has sway in this town, but does it have that much sway? That would be like saying proper resources for community and kids sport can get nicked, while we put billions of dollars to stadiums for rugby league and . . . And, oh, wait! Gladys, it is a nonsense, and you must know it. If you give the green light to league, you must give the green light to us all. If that is the case, can we all be told, too? At the very least you, and the NRL, have to make a compelling case for rugby league exceptionalism. Right now, it ain’t obvious. In the wake of Nick Farr-Jones and me firing shots from opposite sides of the rugby parapet this week, I have been bemused by several people wondering how we are going as friends? The answer is – notwithstanding a few tight, taut texts – fine! The position remains, either he will carry my coffin, or I will carry his. We have disagreed many on things for exactly 40 years, this year, and if this disagreement is stronger than most, so be it. I strongly disagree with his contention that Raelene Castle pulled the wrong rein on Israel Folau, as it obvious to me and most that in the face of that conflagration she and the board had no choice but to react the way they did. I have no clue specifically what the 10 Wallaby captains want the new board and new CEO to do that the old board and former CEO weren’t doing, beyond the motherhood blandishments contained in the letter. And I equally think that the optics of the 11 captains – Michael Lynagh later withdrew his signature – signing the letter 24 hours before Ms Castle was harassed from office were terrible. Whoever takes over from Castle – Farr-Jones is publically pushing hard for Phil Kearns – will have an enormous job ahead to bring the rugby community back together and convince the mob that it is not a case of the boys from Boys Club breaking the door down and charging in so they can be put back in charge. But against all that, I equally accept that the collective motivation of the signatories of the letter was only for the good of rugby. Farr-Jones personally remains the greatest and longest-standing servant of the game in Australia and has my deep respect for that, among many things. In short, rugby supporters, stay tuned. We will be back, after this brief brawl. The biography Anna Meares: Now came out this week, and there are some cracker yarns in it. It was a few weeks out from the 2012 London Olympics see, and our greatest ever track cyclist was about to take on not just Great Britain’s world champion, Victoria Pendleton, aka ‘Queen Victoria’, but her parochial British fans as well. It is daunting, but her coach Nick Flyger has an idea. Why not approach John Eales, who is working with the Australian Olympic team as an athlete liaison officer … Anna Meares at the London 2012 Olympic Games.Credit:Brendan Esposito “He has faced the New Zealand haka,” says Flyger. “If you’re going to face Victoria Pendleton in front of her home crowd, then you need to take some gold from him.” It is all arranged. “So, John, what was your secret?” Anna asks. Eales explains. It’s all about the set-up. Let them do their haka, their explosions of joy and rage and all the rest. But . . . But then sort yourself to have enough time between the finish of the haka, and the start of the match. In the case of the Wallabies it was wearing the track-suits for the haka, and then taking your time taking them off and lining up for the kick-off. In your case, Anna, you’ll work it out. Done. For the gold medal race at the velodrome in London, where the crowd noise reached levels akin to that of a jet plane, Pendleton is first on the track. Where is Anna? She and her coach are still on the edge of track, discussing tactics. By the time they reach the start, the crowd has gone quiet. Queen Victoria looks nervous. Anna charges to a famous victory. A happy ending? Yes, and it gets happier still. She and Nick Flyger are now a couple and in February welcomed their first child, a daughter named Evelyn. Raelene Castle resigns as CEO of Rugby Australia: “In the last couple of hours, it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need. The game is bigger than any one individual — so this evening I told the chair [Paul McLean] that I would resign from the role.” Todd Greenberg: “It has been my great honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last 4 years. Despite the variety of challenges and pressures I have loved every single minute of the journey. Our growth over the last 4 years has been extraordinary and I am very proud of my contribution to the game.”  @Steele_sports comments on Twitter, as the second CEO of a major football code bites the dust in three days: “First Covid-19 now the sequel CEO-2.” @marty_McFly_01: “No live action so league and union engage in a foot-shooting contest.” I think rugby union is just ahead at the moment, but it may have to come down to golden point. Who shoots the last little toe off first, wins. Excerpt from the letter signed by a slew of Wallaby captains and sent to incumbent chair Paul McLean: “In recent times, the Australian game has lost its way. It is a defeat inflicted not by COVID-19, or an on-field foe, but rather by poor administration and leadership over a number of years. We speak as one voice when we say Australian rugby needs new vision, leadership and a plan for the future. That plan must involve, as a priority, urgent steps to create a much-needed, sustainable, commercial rugby business.” Michael Lynagh withdrew his name the next morning. Tony Shaw, himself a distinguished Wallaby captain, on the letter signed by his brethren: “I'm gobsmacked. Why put it in the public domain when you have a chairman, who was a captain, just like you, who's done every job in rugby known to man – from player, captain, coach, administrator and president – and worked his butt off to work through the pandemic fallout in a short time frame?” Peter V’Landys won’t replace Greenberg with himself: “I’ve made that clear that I won’t do it. I’m not interested in it and I’ve never been interested in doing it. I don’t think it’s appropriate: there needs to be a segregation between the board and management. I’ve always believed in proper corporate governance, so it would be hypocritical to do anything other than that.” A Nine spokesperson on the NRL’s intended restart on May 28: “Although we agree constructive discussions have been held between the NRL, Nine and Foxtel, we feel it's premature to be confirming a start date at this stage.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in response to the NRL’s claim that the governments have signed off on the plan to restart the comp: “There is no detailed plan. I call on the NRL to submit that detailed plan and I will immediately forward it to [Queensland Chief Health Officer] Dr Young for her consideration and to report back to me.” Marty McFly, one of the Twitterati: “So a couple of hundred players, staff, broadcasting types and assorted hangers on can gather for a game of league but only a handful of my mates can see me off if I drop dead tomorrow? Working man’s game?” Cricket umpire Ian Gould on Australian cricket eventually crossing the line: “I believe Australia were out of control leading up to the ball-tampering issues. Deep down, we [umpires] let them down in that we should have nailed them three years previously but we let it go, let it go, let it go and it just exploded.” Australian cyclist Rohan Dennis on social media. He later deleted his accounts: “Day 34 - cracked and left the house. #covid19 can suck my ass and so can #quarantine.” I protest. Among other things, in Australia, it is spelt “arse.” Arsenal supporter Aaron Hughes on Chelsea player Jorginho sending a personal message to his girlfriend: “He’s Chelsea’s vice-captain and gives off this family-man image and there he is sending texts to my girlfriend. What sort of example is that? What made it even worse, as an Arsenal fan, was to see him score against us in December. They ended up winning. That just added to my pain.” Collingwood football star Mason Cox, an American, after watching a protester against isolation in his homeland proclaim, “What do I say to the science? I say I don’t believe your science, because I believe my God.” “Well after seeing that I don’t know that I’m ever going to leave Australia again. US, it’s been real but I’m out.” Todd Greenberg. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Raelene Castle. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Peter V’Landys. His psychological grip on the denizens of rugby league seems to have strengthened in recent weeks. Odd that a bloke unknown to the broad mass of the league community – at least as a football figure – until a couple of years ago should now be the one laying down the law and cracking the whip even to people who’ve been in the game for 40 years! Liverpool. Never do things the easy way. Without Corona, they would have, I’m told, won the league a long time ago. Peter FitzSimons is a journalist and columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald.

22,/sport/amateur-hour-returns-as-castle-crumbling-sends-rugby-back-to-the-past-20200424-p54mtn.html,Amateur hour returns as Castle crumbling sends rugby back to the past,"As rugby in Australia takes one giant leap into amateurism, followers can take reassurance from the fact that its leadership is setting the example. Consider the king-hit on Raelene Castle on Thursday. For 24 hours, she had been excluded from phone hook-ups with staff and directors. On Thursday, she gave an interview to the ABC’s 7.30 program in which she said the usual things about continuing to run the game in the face of her personal critics and the underlying problems, namely that the professional code, coronavirus or no coronavirus, is rooted. Replay   This interview was allowed to happen even while the board was about to let her know that she had lost their confidence. Oh dear, but the interview had already been recorded. Leigh Sales broke the news of Castle’s resignation on 7.30, and then played the interview, which was now as redundant as its subject. Talk about amateur hour. The sooner everyone in rugby is back working for nothing, the more honest a game it will be. The COVID-19 crisis, as we’re all finding out, is an unfolding drama of revelation. We are finding out what people and institutions are made of. In this killing season for chief executives, rugby has shown that it was still true to its cultural roots: private schoolboys too brain-dead to organise a piss-up on Zoom. No, that’s too harsh on schoolboys. Whatever your opinion of Castle’s performance during her three-year tenure, positive or negative, her resignation laid bare a degree of disorganisation that, frankly, would be an embarrassment to most suburban clubs. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  Days earlier, rugby league had shown how to do it. Again, whatever the rights and wrongs, whatever the agendas behind Todd Greenberg’s removal, whatever the cold-bloodedness of the Game of Thrones drama that he lost, whatever Greenberg’s overall legacy may be, it can be said that the NRL carries out its executions skilfully. Greenberg and his chairman, Peter V’landys, put out an unconvincing but tight statement of mutuality, and then Greenberg donned a smile and told the public he was proud of his tenure and would remain league’s biggest fan. He was given as dignified a departure as circumstances allowed. He was put away with a swift thrust of a shiv up under the ribcage. Castle, by contrast, was carved up by blind butchers with a blunt blade. You couldn’t make this one up. The black comedy had started with an open letter signed by 11, no 10, former Wallaby captains whingeing from the sidelines, offering no solutions other than bleating for a change of leadership. (Hey, isn’t that the media’s job?) As a coup, it was akin to the officers of the Titanic coming to the realisation that the best response to the hole in the hull was to seize the wheel from the captain and turn back for Southampton. Former Wallaby teammates Phil Kearns and Nick Farr-Jones were both in the halls of power throughout many of rugby's recent dramas.Credit:Simon Aleka Then there was the identification of Nick Farr-Jones and Phil Kearns as the strongest personalities behind the letter. Where were they when the game was heading for the iceberg? In its boardrooms. If Farr-Jones were in a position of influence, then Israel Folau would still be playing for the Wallabies and continuing to speak from a place of love. Only he wouldn’t, because the Wallabies wouldn’t have any sponsors, and if there’s one thing we know about Folau, it’s that he’s not going to hang around in a sport without any money. But apparently Folau’s place of love was Raelene Castle’s fault. Competence no longer mattered. The gentlemen’s club had gathered together and stamped their feet. Farr-Jones’s standing comes from the fact that he was one of the greatest Wallabies. There is no doubt about his distinction on the field. He has backed a push for his fellow Newington College Old Boy Kearns to become CEO. Kearns was also an iconic Wallaby, a World Cup winner in Farr-Jones’s team best known for sticking it up his All Blacks opposite number Sean Fitzpatrick back in 1990. An inspiring moment from the amateur era. On the other hand, Kearns’s capacity for original, insightful thinking and articulate understanding of the game has been on public display every week for Fox Sports. The open letter upheld anyone’s ideal of amateurism, right down to counting the numbers. And then there were 10. Michael ‘Noddy’ Lynagh, who received Farr-Jones’s bullet-like passes for so many years, had signed the letter and booted it downfield without reading the fine print. Or the large print. Noddy nodded along and nodded off. His personal fortune is currently on its way to Nigeria. Todd Greenberg and Raelene Castle, pictured here in happier times in 2013 when the former took over from Greenberg at the Bulldogs, both lost their jobs this week.Credit:Wolter Peeters At least Lynagh had the courage to swallow his embarrassment and back out publicly. That took guts. As a dissenter, he joined the other captains who did not sign the letter: John Eales, Mark Ella, Tony Shaw, Mark Loane, Phil Waugh, Tim Horan, David Wilson and Grand Slam winner Andrew Slack. Plenty of grise on both sides, but more eminence among the non-signatories. If this was a failed coup, its disorganisation, poor tactical sense, questionable motives and absence of content were a combined masterstroke. Competence no longer mattered. The gentlemen’s club had gathered together and stamped their feet. Over at the NRL, Greenberg said he was proud of his legacy of encouraging inclusiveness in league. He didn’t invent inclusiveness, but he recognised that it is an underlying force that is going to outlive all the daily skirmishes and revolving-door managers. Rugby, two days later, sacrificed a chief executive in the name of exclusiveness. Those who thought Folau never did anything wrong have now received their payback. As rugby’s constituency shrinks back to its true-blue heartland, Mosman rules. Rugby was for years the sick man of Australian sport, but now it’s just the one that’s been in the hospital ward the longest. It’s been joined by a few mates. The sky has fallen in on all sports democratically, but they are all showing their true character. Rugby league is about the ruthless pursuit of self-interest and bending the rules to its advantage. Rugby union is about restoring a mythical past. Cricket – we’ll get to cricket another day. Truth is, the day the CEO of Rugby Australia arrives in their office they are served up a big poo sandwich. Castle, like Bill Pulver before her, put in years of earnest effort but was ultimately not judged to be eating that sandwich in a sufficiently manly, Wallaby style. Someone else will be found to do it. Let’s hope it isn’t one of those dogs who chase cars all day, only, when the car stops for them, to have no idea what to do with it. At these times, when all are left lying in the same gutter looking at the same stars, it might not make much difference who takes stewardship of a game’s decline. When solvency is the issue, big names and big egos aren’t going to register. The Sydney-based gentlemen’s club has reasserted its prerogatives. Now it’s full-steam ahead to 1991.

The pair had made hundreds of phone calls to each other in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic threatened the future of Australian rugby. But this one was different. Castle, at this stage still the Rugby Australia chief executive, was taping a pre-recorded interview with the ABC's current affairs flagship, 7.30, that afternoon. Replay   She wanted to know if there was anything coming down the pipeline at her before she went on national television to present a united front for the riven code. As McLean explained in detail on Friday, ""all [Castle] ever wanted was to know that the board supported her and whilst that was the case she would run through broken glass to get things done"".  She asked that if, at any stage they believed the game was better off with someone else at the helm, that they be open and upfront about it. The answer from McLean on Thursday morning was 'no'. What the respected former Wallabies captain meant was 'nothing in the next 48 hours'. What is now clear, acknowledge by McLean and confirmed by another board source, was that the interim chairman and the seven other non-executive directors – Phil Waugh, Pip Marlow, Hayden Rorke, John Wilson, Daniel Herbert, Peter Wiggs and Brett Godfrey – had decided it was time to move on Castle during a conference call the night before. But Castle, satisfied with her chairman's reassurance the next morning, recorded the interview at Rugby Australia's Moore Park headquarters, wrapping up at about 4.15pm on Thursday, in the belief she had the board's backing. She spoke to presenter Leigh Sales about the damaging letter signed by 10 Wallabies captains, calling for sweeping change, that had dropped on Monday night and eclipsed RA's closing of a time-buying pay deal with the game's 192 professional players. Rugby Australia chairman Paul McLean. She deflected a question about the relentless criticism levelled at her over her gender, nationality and appearance, chalking it up to the rough and tumble of sports administration. And she spoke, somewhat elegiacally, about the impending arrival of new Wallabies coach Dave Rennie: ""He will come here regardless of where I sit but I would certainly like the opportunity to work with him because together I think we can deliver some really great outcomes."" Castle will not get that chance. She finished the interview and was confronted by a raft of media enquiries, to her directly and to RA's corporate affairs boss Michael Earsman, asking whether she was aware of the board's intention to sack her within the next week. She was not, the message came back to the Herald, and was not aware the non-executive directors had met on Wednesday night. Alarm bells rang at 5pm when Castle did not join an important conference call with the Super Rugby chairmen, Wiggs and chief financial officer Simon Rabbitt, that had been called to give the states their first look at RA's 2019 financials and cash position and forecasts. No one could explain her absence. She was on the phone to McLean again, asking him to explain whether the media knew something she didn't. This time, the chairman levelled with her. Wednesday night's call had resolved that it was time for fresh leadership, but had not finalised a time frame to make that happen and, crucially, did not have a plan for who would take her place. They were planning to talk to Castle early next week to let her know their thinking. Castle, hurt that the board had allowed her to record the ABC interview – it ended up going to air with a preamble including the chief executive's resignation statement – wanted to take control. She told McLean she was resigning. ""In the last couple of hours it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need,"" she said in a statement. ""The game is bigger than any one individual – so this evening I told the chair that I would resign from the role. I will do whatever is needed to ensure an orderly handover."" The source told the Herald that most of the directors wanted it noted that the Wallabies captains' letter had nothing to do with their decision to move on Castle. But, with the RUPA pay deal locked away, securing more than $12 million in savings on player wages over the next two quarters, and a World Rugby loan application all but granted, it was felt the organisation could start looking beyond September and to what a rebuild might look like. As McLean said on Friday morning: ""...in a normal circumstance without the things that happened in the last two years and some of the unwarranted criticisms and bullying, I think it might have been a different scenario. At the end of the day the board has to make a decision about how the game can progress and if there was a clearer pathway to doing that, we needed to take that pathway because we represent and manage the whole of the game."" The ""last two years"" was likely a reference to the Israel Folau saga, which broke three months into Castle's time at Moore Park and all but swallowed up the game for much of the next 18 months. Raelene Castle at the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne in December.Credit:AAP There was also a feeling that the virus outbreak and the ensuing shutdown presented the board with an opportunity to reshape the structure of the game in Australia, from competitions to governance.

It was only a pity they did not save Castle from one last humiliation, finding out from the media her days were numbered.

Rennie had given no specific commitment to that end in the wake of Castle's sudden departure on Thursday, but nor had he given any indication his dedication was wavering, a Wallabies source told the Herald. Replay   The New Zealander, who is still contracted to Glasgow in the Pro14, has continued working closely with his Australian-based assistants on building out the Wallabies program. As speculation intensified around Castle's future, sources close to Rennie had warned twice over the past month that the former Chiefs coach may not be prepared to work under anyone other than the CEO who recruited him. When Castle handed in her resignation on Thursday evening, one of the first calls both she and director of rugby Scott Johnson made was to Rennie. A source described the coach's reaction as extremely disappointed but also understanding that best-laid plans can go awry and that he remained committed to coaching Australia. Incoming Wallabies coach Dave Rennie. Credit:AAP ""They had developed a friendship, it was an important relationship to both of them, so there was disappointment on Dave's part,"" the source said. ""But he is also a diligent man who acts with honour. He still wants to do the job."" It would be a major blow to Australian rugby if Rennie were to walk away from his deal, which was due to see him arrive in Australia in late June or early July. Asked whether Castle’s exit would affect Rennie's arrival, RA chairman Paul McLean said on Friday: “I haven’t spoken to Dave, I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago. [Director of rugby] Scott Johnson spoke to him last night. Raelene has spoken him as well.” Speaking on ABC’s 7.30 program before standing down on Thursday, Castle said she believed Rennie would honour his commitment. “I know he has a desperate desire to coach the Wallabies and he has done a lot of work in the time leading up to when he arrives,” Castle said. “He is excited about the young talent he sees coming through on our platforms. That was one of the major reasons he decided to sign with Rugby Australia and come here. “He will come here regardless of where I sit.” Even if Rennie does take the job, there is the issue of getting him to Australia due to border restrictions, depending on if and when Tests can be played this year. Meanwhile, it appears Castle's exit won’t change RA’s support for Gus Pichot at the upcoming World Rugby elections. McLean made it very clear Australia and other southern hemisphere national unions would not support incumbent chairman Bill Beaumont, who is running against Pichot, the former Argentinian halfback, in next month’s World Rugby Council meetings. The sticking point is the Nations Championship which never got off the ground. The competition would have pitted southern and northern hemisphere teams against one another but was knocked on the head by a number of Six Nations unions who were concerned about the promotion and relegation aspect and how it could affect their revenues. It means Beamount, the former England captain, won’t be on Australia’s ticket. “We were very disappointed that we didn’t get the global competition up and running last year. No greater interest than self interest,” McLean said. “We thought it would have been a defining moment in our game and it was well thought through. We thought it was a no-brainer. That didn’t happen and we made it clear that we were unhappy about that and the process. We stuck together and let it be known to the northern hemisphere.

McLean also said he still planned to stand down as interim chair before July 31, but that could be moved forward. “The immediate future of that role is being discussed,” McLean said. “I will adopt the role of executive chair for a very short period until such time as we meet the executive team on Monday and map out what the next steps might be in terms of either an interim CEO running in parallel with a program to seek a process to appoint a full-time CEO down the track.” McLean spoke strongly about his disgust at the personal attacks directed towards Castle during her time at the helm of RA. “I’m not a social media person but I’m aware of some of the things that were said over a period of time in a quite vicious and vitriolic way. It’s the silent forces, the dark forces, they’re the things that upset me most,” McLean told reporters via a teleconference on Friday. “It’s the people who didn’t know the facts or were just one of those faceless people out there - that was the damaging thing from her perspective. She shared some of that with me, which I found quite abhorrent. “One of my greatest concerns with her was her welfare and how she was on a daily basis.

I would have understood that. “We’ve had some broader discussions about that over the last six months and I suppose it crystallised with some new eyes around the board table and it probably crystallised given the circumstances we all face from a general economy. “Without the things that happened in the last two years and some of the unwarranted criticisms and bullying, I think it might have been a different scenario.” Asked whether he was comfortable with the board’s leadership when criticism was levelled at Castle, who was often made to be a scapegoat, McLean argued it was a tough situation. “If defending someone and doing it as best you can is not going to be news, you’re not going to get a run,” McLean said. “It was very difficult for us to get airtime in some of those areas.

McLean made it clear that a letter signed by 10 former Wallabies captains calling for the board to stand down did not influence the decision to punt Castle, and the Queenslander took a subtle swipe at his fellow ex-Test captains. “It’s a very small collective of people who have been involved in the game of late … the significance of that group is probably the people who aren’t on the list,” McLean said. “It’s great people want to put their hand up and be involved but they need to be part of the process.

I would have understood that. “We’ve had some broader discussions about that over the last six months and I suppose it crystallised with some new eyes around the board table and it probably crystallised given the circumstances we all face from a general economy. “Without the things that happened in the last two years and some of the unwarranted criticisms and bullying, I think it might have been a different scenario.” Asked whether he was comfortable with the board’s leadership when criticism was levelled at Castle, who was often made to be a scapegoat, McLean argued it was a tough situation. “If defending someone and doing it as best you can is not going to be news, you’re not going to get a run,” McLean said. “It was very difficult for us to get airtime in some of those areas. (Former RA chairman) Cameron Clyne finished up getting some space to write an article in one newspaper to even out the process and let people know what was actually happening. I don’t think it looked like that [criticism] was going to go away any time soon. Rugby Australia's Paul McLean and Raelene Castle.Credit:SMH It comes as Alan Jones continued his sustained criticism of Castle, saying on 2GB on Friday morning she ""knows nothing about the game"". McLean made it clear that a letter signed by 10 former Wallabies captains calling for the board to stand down did not influence the decision to punt Castle, and the Queenslander took a subtle swipe at his fellow ex-Test captains. “It’s a very small collective of people who have been involved in the game of late … the significance of that group is probably the people who aren’t on the list,” McLean said. “It’s great people want to put their hand up and be involved but they need to be part of the process. I think that group, the Nick Farr-Jones group, could easily - and I suggested to them - join in with that wider group [who want to help] very easily.""

Consider the king-hit on Raelene Castle on Thursday. For 24 hours, she had been excluded from phone hook-ups with staff and directors. On Thursday, she gave an interview to the ABC’s 7.30 program in which she said the usual things about continuing to run the game in the face of her personal critics and the underlying problems, namely that the professional code, coronavirus or no coronavirus, is rooted. Replay   This interview was allowed to happen even while the board was about to let her know that she had lost their confidence. Oh dear, but the interview had already been recorded. Leigh Sales broke the news of Castle’s resignation on 7.30, and then played the interview, which was now as redundant as its subject. Talk about amateur hour. The sooner everyone in rugby is back working for nothing, the more honest a game it will be. The COVID-19 crisis, as we’re all finding out, is an unfolding drama of revelation. We are finding out what people and institutions are made of. In this killing season for chief executives, rugby has shown that it was still true to its cultural roots: private schoolboys too brain-dead to organise a piss-up on Zoom. No, that’s too harsh on schoolboys. Whatever your opinion of Castle’s performance during her three-year tenure, positive or negative, her resignation laid bare a degree of disorganisation that, frankly, would be an embarrassment to most suburban clubs. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  Days earlier, rugby league had shown how to do it. Again, whatever the rights and wrongs, whatever the agendas behind Todd Greenberg’s removal, whatever the cold-bloodedness of the Game of Thrones drama that he lost, whatever Greenberg’s overall legacy may be, it can be said that the NRL carries out its executions skilfully. Greenberg and his chairman, Peter V’landys, put out an unconvincing but tight statement of mutuality, and then Greenberg donned a smile and told the public he was proud of his tenure and would remain league’s biggest fan. He was given as dignified a departure as circumstances allowed. He was put away with a swift thrust of a shiv up under the ribcage. Castle, by contrast, was carved up by blind butchers with a blunt blade. You couldn’t make this one up. The black comedy had started with an open letter signed by 11, no 10, former Wallaby captains whingeing from the sidelines, offering no solutions other than bleating for a change of leadership. (Hey, isn’t that the media’s job?) As a coup, it was akin to the officers of the Titanic coming to the realisation that the best response to the hole in the hull was to seize the wheel from the captain and turn back for Southampton. Former Wallaby teammates Phil Kearns and Nick Farr-Jones were both in the halls of power throughout many of rugby's recent dramas.Credit:Simon Aleka Then there was the identification of Nick Farr-Jones and Phil Kearns as the strongest personalities behind the letter. Where were they when the game was heading for the iceberg? In its boardrooms. If Farr-Jones were in a position of influence, then Israel Folau would still be playing for the Wallabies and continuing to speak from a place of love. Only he wouldn’t, because the Wallabies wouldn’t have any sponsors, and if there’s one thing we know about Folau, it’s that he’s not going to hang around in a sport without any money. But apparently Folau’s place of love was Raelene Castle’s fault. Competence no longer mattered. The gentlemen’s club had gathered together and stamped their feet. Farr-Jones’s standing comes from the fact that he was one of the greatest Wallabies. There is no doubt about his distinction on the field. He has backed a push for his fellow Newington College Old Boy Kearns to become CEO. Kearns was also an iconic Wallaby, a World Cup winner in Farr-Jones’s team best known for sticking it up his All Blacks opposite number Sean Fitzpatrick back in 1990. An inspiring moment from the amateur era. On the other hand, Kearns’s capacity for original, insightful thinking and articulate understanding of the game has been on public display every week for Fox Sports. The open letter upheld anyone’s ideal of amateurism, right down to counting the numbers. And then there were 10. Michael ‘Noddy’ Lynagh, who received Farr-Jones’s bullet-like passes for so many years, had signed the letter and booted it downfield without reading the fine print. Or the large print. Noddy nodded along and nodded off. His personal fortune is currently on its way to Nigeria. Todd Greenberg and Raelene Castle, pictured here in happier times in 2013 when the former took over from Greenberg at the Bulldogs, both lost their jobs this week.Credit:Wolter Peeters At least Lynagh had the courage to swallow his embarrassment and back out publicly. That took guts. As a dissenter, he joined the other captains who did not sign the letter: John Eales, Mark Ella, Tony Shaw, Mark Loane, Phil Waugh, Tim Horan, David Wilson and Grand Slam winner Andrew Slack. Plenty of grise on both sides, but more eminence among the non-signatories. If this was a failed coup, its disorganisation, poor tactical sense, questionable motives and absence of content were a combined masterstroke. Competence no longer mattered. The gentlemen’s club had gathered together and stamped their feet. Over at the NRL, Greenberg said he was proud of his legacy of encouraging inclusiveness in league. He didn’t invent inclusiveness, but he recognised that it is an underlying force that is going to outlive all the daily skirmishes and revolving-door managers. Rugby, two days later, sacrificed a chief executive in the name of exclusiveness. Those who thought Folau never did anything wrong have now received their payback. As rugby’s constituency shrinks back to its true-blue heartland, Mosman rules. Rugby was for years the sick man of Australian sport, but now it’s just the one that’s been in the hospital ward the longest. It’s been joined by a few mates. The sky has fallen in on all sports democratically, but they are all showing their true character. Rugby league is about the ruthless pursuit of self-interest and bending the rules to its advantage. Rugby union is about restoring a mythical past. Cricket – we’ll get to cricket another day. Truth is, the day the CEO of Rugby Australia arrives in their office they are served up a big poo sandwich. Castle, like Bill Pulver before her, put in years of earnest effort but was ultimately not judged to be eating that sandwich in a sufficiently manly, Wallaby style. Someone else will be found to do it. Let’s hope it isn’t one of those dogs who chase cars all day, only, when the car stops for them, to have no idea what to do with it. At these times, when all are left lying in the same gutter looking at the same stars, it might not make much difference who takes stewardship of a game’s decline. When solvency is the issue, big names and big egos aren’t going to register. The Sydney-based gentlemen’s club has reasserted its prerogatives. Now it’s full-steam ahead to 1991.

Dave Rennie at the helm, with internationally-experienced assistants Scott Wisemantel (ex-England) and Matt Taylor (ex-Scotland), Dean Benton and John Pryor (ex-Fiji) in charge of athletic development and Australia's most promising young head coach Dan McKellar in negotiations to join as forwards coach. Replay   That Castle, after resigning suddenly on Thursday evening, will have to watch someone else take credit for what successes Rennie and director of rugby Scott Johnson (also her recruit) might conjure is exquisitely unfair. But this is professional sport and that's life. It is worth putting on the public record one last time, however. In the midst of the coronavirus-induced chaos gripping all sports, and the bloodthirsty opportunism that rose up to meet it in rugby over recent weeks, Castle was blamed for all manner of structural, situational and cyclical problems facing the game. Some of which she had a hand in, some of which she didn't. Two years and three months in the job without a major, demonstrable victory completely eroded the board's confidence. It was not an explosive letter, signed by 10 Wallabies captains, calling for the administration to ""step aside"" this week that cost the former Bulldogs and Netball New Zealand boss her job. It added to the noise but ultimately two years and three months in the job without a major, demonstrable victory completely eroded the board's confidence. On top of that the past month of the coronavirus crisis, which saw her work 20-hour days to strip cost from the organisation and save the game from bankruptcy, put a spotlight on her shortcomings. Castle's stubborn refusal for three weeks to hand over the 2019 balance sheet to the players union as she pursued a pay deal was fatal and unnecessary, costing her the respect of almost all the senior players at a time she needed them onside. Tellingly it was the arrival of new director Peter Wiggs, to whom the board may now look to lead them in the short term, at the negotiating table last week that broke the deadlock. At the same time Wiggs and the other two new directors, Daniel Herbert and Brett Godfrey, were known to be underwhelmed by Castle's detailed knowledge of the business, a flaw brought to light when RA's survival came into question with the prospect of a worst-case scenario $120 million revenue hole if no rugby is played for the rest of the year. Raelene Castle was not always easy to defend, but few of the problems laid at her feet were of her own making.Credit:AAP As for many of the other bullets fired at the Australian-born New Zealander? Some are fair and some ignore the fact Castle's predecessors Bill Pulver and John O'Neill either created, or further entrenched, a business model for the game that saw it chase cash at the expense of competition integrity, all the while throwing bigger and bigger bags of money at players to ward off foreign raiders. Pulver had to torch 20 per cent of the country's professional footprint to save the code from bankruptcy. He stripped so much cost from the business that there was no high performance structure left to catch Ewen McKenzie when his Wallabies' tenure spiralled out of control in 2014. Desperate and with no sports administration experience to help him spot the flaws, Pulver installed Michael Cheika as his replacement, with a similar absence of oversight. But back to Castle. What of last year's $9.4 million loss, thrown around as if it is evidence of her mismanagement? It is hard to say for certain without seeing the books, which were not lodged with ASIC after last month's annual general meeting. But most likely 2019 was a year like any other World Cup year, in which a loss of that scale is forecast. In 2015 RA recorded a $9.8 million loss, and in 2011 it was a $10.6 million deficit. No broadcast deal for 2021? That sits at Castle's feet because she walked away from a $20 million a year offer from current partners Foxtel on the understanding there was broader market interest in rugby's five-yearly rights. But also rotten luck, because the coronavirus outbreak and global shutdown of sport torpedoed negotiations with Optus and free-to-air broadcaster Ten, right at a point when the telco was 48 hours from tabling a formal offer. The appointment of Scott Johnson as Australia's first director of rugby was one of the successes of Castle's reign.Credit:AAP The Israel Folau saga? A bit of both. Folau's repeated anti-gay comments on social media would have tested the best in the business and his ongoing exile from Australian sport proves her stance was correct. Settling out of court for a figure around the $4 million mark, to avoid a high-risk trial and a third season being drowned out by the controversy, was the right call. But her call to re-sign Folau for another four years after his April 2018 comments, on almost as much money - after the withdrawal of a private donor, no less - and then her bungling of that contract, went to the heart of her capacity to run a major sport. Castle trusted Folau and left the organisation with no contractual protection against a breach of that trust, when he doubled down with more anti-gay posts a year later. It meant defending rugby's values would come with a hefty price tag, and was a clear sign to many close observers that she lacked the attention to detail and shrewd pragmatism required for the role. Her poor relationship with Michael Cheika is another failure that can be chalked up to a combination of naivety and poor judgment. Castle made the calculated gamble she could ride out the final two years of the difficult Wallabies coach's contract while building back up the organisation's high performance structures and starting the search for his replacement, who would be her man. A year into her time at Moore Park, when she realised change was necessary, the board baulked. A dismal quarter-final exit at last year's World Cup and ugly verbal brawl at an official Australian Embassy function in Tokyo were the fruit borne of those decisions. It is also true that Castle was the victim of sexism from within the sport's old guard. A former Wallabies coach once told the Herald that Australian rugby couldn't be represented by a woman ""who looks like that"". Vile social media commentary based on gender and appearance trailed Castle's every move - and still does - and within a few months of her arrival at Moore Park a group of powerful former players decided they couldn't handle ""their"" game being run by an outsider, much less a Kiwi. But Castle was never an easy administrator to defend, because of all of the missteps outlined above. Just like Castle's rugby league counterpart, Todd Greenberg, who resigned the NRL post on Tuesday, the world-altering coronavirus swiftly laid bare the structural flaws of both games, and of both leaders. The Wallabies captains might have upped the pressure, but the reality was with rugby in trouble, the board had lost confidence that Castle was the person to lead them out of the mire.

Some are fair and some ignore the fact Castle's predecessors Bill Pulver and John O'Neill either created, or further entrenched, a business model for the game that saw it chase cash at the expense of competition integrity, all the while throwing bigger and bigger bags of money at players to ward off foreign raiders. Pulver had to torch 20 per cent of the country's professional footprint to save the code from bankruptcy. He stripped so much cost from the business that there was no high performance structure left to catch Ewen McKenzie when his Wallabies' tenure spiralled out of control in 2014. Desperate and with no sports administration experience to help him spot the flaws, Pulver installed Michael Cheika as his replacement, with a similar absence of oversight. But back to Castle. What of last year's $9.4 million loss, thrown around as if it is evidence of her mismanagement? It is hard to say for certain without seeing the books, which were not lodged with ASIC after last month's annual general meeting. But most likely 2019 was a year like any other World Cup year, in which a loss of that scale is forecast. In 2015 RA recorded a $9.8 million loss, and in 2011 it was a $10.6 million deficit. No broadcast deal for 2021? That sits at Castle's feet because she walked away from a $20 million a year offer from current partners Foxtel on the understanding there was broader market interest in rugby's five-yearly rights. But also rotten luck, because the coronavirus outbreak and global shutdown of sport torpedoed negotiations with Optus and free-to-air broadcaster Ten, right at a point when the telco was 48 hours from tabling a formal offer. The appointment of Scott Johnson as Australia's first director of rugby was one of the successes of Castle's reign.Credit:AAP The Israel Folau saga? A bit of both. Folau's repeated anti-gay comments on social media would have tested the best in the business and his ongoing exile from Australian sport proves her stance was correct. Settling out of court for a figure around the $4 million mark, to avoid a high-risk trial and a third season being drowned out by the controversy, was the right call. But her call to re-sign Folau for another four years after his April 2018 comments, on almost as much money - after the withdrawal of a private donor, no less - and then her bungling of that contract, went to the heart of her capacity to run a major sport. Castle trusted Folau and left the organisation with no contractual protection against a breach of that trust, when he doubled down with more anti-gay posts a year later. It meant defending rugby's values would come with a hefty price tag, and was a clear sign to many close observers that she lacked the attention to detail and shrewd pragmatism required for the role. Her poor relationship with Michael Cheika is another failure that can be chalked up to a combination of naivety and poor judgment. Castle made the calculated gamble she could ride out the final two years of the difficult Wallabies coach's contract while building back up the organisation's high performance structures and starting the search for his replacement, who would be her man. A year into her time at Moore Park, when she realised change was necessary, the board baulked. A dismal quarter-final exit at last year's World Cup and ugly verbal brawl at an official Australian Embassy function in Tokyo were the fruit borne of those decisions. It is also true that Castle was the victim of sexism from within the sport's old guard. A former Wallabies coach once told the Herald that Australian rugby couldn't be represented by a woman ""who looks like that"". Vile social media commentary based on gender and appearance trailed Castle's every move - and still does - and within a few months of her arrival at Moore Park a group of powerful former players decided they couldn't handle ""their"" game being run by an outsider, much less a Kiwi. But Castle was never an easy administrator to defend, because of all of the missteps outlined above. Just like Castle's rugby league counterpart, Todd Greenberg, who resigned the NRL post on Tuesday, the world-altering coronavirus swiftly laid bare the structural flaws of both games, and of both leaders. The Wallabies captains might have upped the pressure, but the reality was with rugby in trouble, the board had lost confidence that Castle was the person to lead them out of the mire.

Cricket Australia says big hits will keep coming,"The nation was on the brink of COVID lockdown, Australia having just played New Zealand before a deserted SCG, when Cricket Australia realised it might go broke. On March 19, chief executive Kevin Roberts canvassed the possibility to stunned board members that the game could run out of money by the end of August. His language was measured but, to experienced corporate directors dialled into the Microsoft Teams conference call, the implications were clear. David Warner and Aaron Finch marched on to an empty SCG to take on New Zealand in early March.Credit:AAP Without an urgent financial overhaul, cricket’s national governing body risked trading while insolvent. At a glance, Cricket Australia’s balance sheet appeared healthy. With its broadcast partners having deposited the latest instalment of a six-year, $1.8 billion rights deal, it had nearly $100 million squirrelled away for the winter. Yet, as Roberts mapped the outgoings, the mounting pressure on its broadcast and corporate partners and the impact of the sharemarket crash on Cricket Australia’s investment fund, his projections showed that the dollars could disappear quicker than a legside full toss. “It was certainly plausible that our cash and investments could track down to zero at the end of August, absolutely,’’ Roberts says. “Which is why we’ve had to take the action that we have.’’ Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts.Credit:Getty Images Not everyone in cricket is convinced. Two of the game's most influential stakeholders, the professional players and state associations, are sceptical about the depth of the financial crisis and the explanations given so far by Cricket Australia. They have asked to see more detailed financial information before they agree to Cricket Australia’s proposal to cut player payments and grants to the states by a quarter. Roberts warns the game must prepare for a “new normal” after the pandemic with significantly reduced revenue. At a minimum, Cricket Australia is seeking to cut 25 per cent from its operating costs and for the states and players to accept a proportionate cut. It is also planning for things to get a lot worse. Replay   “What we have done is to make sure we have a plan for cricket to withstand a 50 per cent reduction in revenue if we need it to,’’ he tells The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. “It is not suggesting things will get to that point but it is ensuring we don’t retrospectively find that we haven’t planned appropriately for what we could be facing in the following financial year. “Part of this was dealing with issues that have occurred already and part of it is making sure that cricket can withstand the issues that may come at us next season.” This Rumsfeldian mix of known and unknowns has made for a muddled explanation as to how a game so flush with cash could get to this point. As the chief executive of one corporate partner put it, “the numbers don’t stack up”. Within Cricket Australia there is acknowledgment that even without the pandemic the organisation’s cashflow would have cut uncomfortably close to the bone this winter. A game which generated total revenue of $486 million in FY 2019 was predicted to get down to its last $40 million. This wild fluctuation in cash flow, although a product of the vagaries of the international touring schedule, the disparate drawing power of England and India compared with other nations and the seasonal nature of cricket revenue, prompted Cricket Australia before the COVID crisis to consider a capital working facility – a secure line of credit from a bank – to better manage its financial peaks and troughs. “It is evident that in addition to holding reserves we need an ongoing, working capital facility to buffer against the significant ups and downs,’’ Roberts says. When Roberts added in the potential impact of the pandemic, the board backed his decision to bring in an experienced corporate toe-cutter Paul Reining, to take charge of finances at Jolimont. The Cricket Australia crisis management team comprises Reining, who previously helped Roberts restructure the financially stricken sports apparel company 2XU, chief operating officer Scott Grant, CA chairman Earl Eddings and board members Paul Green and Michelle Tredenick. Eddings is the managing director of a risk management company, Green a KPMG partner and Tredenick a board member of the Insurance Australia Group and Bank of Queensland. Cricket Australia’s long-serving chief financial officer Todd Shand, having resigned in January, agreed to stay on to help weather the crisis. There are four parts to cricket’s plan for financial survival; to secure a working capital facility, to cut the organisation’s operating expenses, to reduce grants to the states and to reach agreement with the players’ union for an “amended player payment model.” The most dramatic step taken so far is Cricket Australia’s decision to stand down until June 30 about 80 per cent of its staff. Cricket Australia has registered for the federal government JobKeeper scheme but is uncertain whether it will apply. It will pay affected staff either 20 per cent of their wages or the JobKeeper amount of $1500 a fortnight, depending which is higher. Roberts and his executive team have accepted a 20 per cent pay cut and a waiving of all performance bonuses for this financial year. Roberts says the mass standing down will preserve about $3 million of expenses but the decision is less about saving money than spending it responsibly. COVID restrictions means that, for many Cricket Australia staff, there is simply not enough work to do. Roberts said that Cricket Australia, a not-for-profit organisation, can’t keep paying people full time salaries to not work. “People wouldn’t have been engaged in many cases at all and in some cases, part time, in the normal activities that would happen in this period of the year. We’ve had two tours cancelled. We have various training programs cancelled and other activities cancelled. That is what led us to this particular point.” Roberts is less clear on why the COVID lockdown, an episode which began after Cricket Australia had staged all but one of last summer's international matches, triggered a financial crisis within the game. According to Roberts, the net impact of the pandemic so far is a $20 million reduction in Cricket Australia’s cash and investment reserves. The grounding of international and interstate travel, including a women’s tour to South Africa and men’s tour to Bangladesh, has saved CA about $20 million. This means that, since March, the pandemic has stripped in the order of $40 million from CA’s accounts. Where has the money gone? There was a loss caused by the cancelled one day international against New Zealand and Cricket Australia has needed to find more money to bankroll the operations of its T20 World Cup organising committee, which must keep preparing for the possibility of a tournament this summer but can't raise funds through ticket sales or events. Roberts says the largest single loss to Cricket Australia, about $10 million, is from a sharp depreciation of its investment fund since February. However, that loss will only be realised if Cricket Australia is forced to sell its shares. Roberts remains hopeful that it won’t. The final, COVID-related hit to Cricket Australia’s finances nominated by Roberts is “bad debtors”; the prospect of corporate partners and other debtors being unable to meet their payments. Cricket sources say the assumed loss from bad debtors is estimated to be close to $20 million. Roberts is unwilling to disclose the details of Cricket Australia’s sponsorship arrangements but says the full impact of the pandemic on the sports market is still to be felt. India are due to tour again this summer - but possibly to empty grounds.Credit:Scott Barbour “What has been incurred thus far is not the lion’s share of it. We are obviously anticipating an ongoing impact, like many organisations, in terms of our debtors. We are looking at the current trends and anticipating what that means in the current months.” This is the looming, billion-dollar question for cricket and other professional sports. India is due to tour this summer but if they come, they will almost certainly play before empty stadiums. The last time India played a Test series here, nearly half a million people walked through the turnstiles. The difference to Cricket Australia is about $50 million.

However, this is not believed to be favoured by the clubs, who regard points-per-game as the fairest method.

51,/sport/soccer/a-league-to-resume-only-after-government-approval-is-given-20200423-p54mg9.html,A-League to resume only after government approval is given,"FFA have sought advice from the Bundesliga and Bayern Munich about managing a return to games after the delay caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic but won't set a date for resumption of the season until approval from state and federal government is obtained. There is no certainty when the season will kick-off again,  hampered by the lack of guarantee from Fox Sports whether they will televise the remainder of the season, as the broadcaster continues to keep FFA in the dark over the TV deal's future. It leaves the A-League's position in stark contrast to that of the NRL, which has pushed on with ambitious plans for a return to competition by May 28 and is also reportedly close to agreeing a renewed TV deal with Fox Sports. Instead, A-League clubs have been given no assurances from the pay TV provider it will honour the remainder of the contract, with sources suggesting Fox Sports could seek to walk away as early as Thursday. Tough task: FFA chief executive James Johnson is set for talks with Fox Sports.Credit:AAP A clause ensuring no disruption of the season for more than 20 business days could give Fox Sports a window to climb out of the remaining three years of the broadcast deal, despite assurances from FFA chief James Johnson that finishing the 2019-20 A-League season remains a priority of the organisation.

52,/sport/soccer/a-league-to-resume-only-after-government-approval-is-given-20200423-p54mg9.html,A-League to resume only after government approval is given,"FFA have sought advice from the Bundesliga and Bayern Munich about managing a return to games after the delay caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic but won't set a date for resumption of the season until approval from state and federal government is obtained. There is no certainty when the season will kick-off again,  hampered by the lack of guarantee from Fox Sports whether they will televise the remainder of the season, as the broadcaster continues to keep FFA in the dark over the TV deal's future. It leaves the A-League's position in stark contrast to that of the NRL, which has pushed on with ambitious plans for a return to competition by May 28 and is also reportedly close to agreeing a renewed TV deal with Fox Sports. Instead, A-League clubs have been given no assurances from the pay TV provider it will honour the remainder of the contract, with sources suggesting Fox Sports could seek to walk away as early as Thursday. Tough task: FFA chief executive James Johnson is set for talks with Fox Sports.Credit:AAP A clause ensuring no disruption of the season for more than 20 business days could give Fox Sports a window to climb out of the remaining three years of the broadcast deal, despite assurances from FFA chief James Johnson that finishing the 2019-20 A-League season remains a priority of the organisation.

The Lions are not the only NFL team showing interest in the 27-year-old punter in the lead-up to this week's NFL draft. The Atlanta Falcons have also kept in regular touch with Siposs. The New York Jets, in the market for a punter after not re-signing Australian Lachlan Edwards, also gave Siposs a call. After two seasons with Auburn, one of American college football's elite programs, Siposs entered the draft and is considered one of the top punting prospects.

The MCG is central to the league’s plans for a July return, according to stadium sources. MCC chief executive Stuart Fox was unavailable to comment but a spokeswoman said groundstaff had kept the venue in a condition to immediately host multiple games per week once the AFL was given the all clear to resume. Replay   The AFL shutdown has created a looming clash with cricket, although cricket’s season is also up in the air with the Twenty20 World Cup in doubt, and India’s travel plans for a lucrative Test series uncertain. As The Age reported last month, the Melbourne Cricket Club does not yet have a contract with Cricket Australia for the Boxing Day Test but expects to strike an agreement for the event to go ahead at the ’G. The AFL is yet to determine how deep into October, November and potentially December it will need to go, but under its current agreement the AFL would have access to the ground until October 10. It seems all but certain that the AFL will return using a number of hubs, with AFL Players Association president Patrick Dangerfield conceding that a normal return to play appears unlikely. League sources have confirmed to The Age that while all six states are being considered, there will also be plans for the Northern Territory and the ACT to host hubs, should they be required. Patrick Dangerfield has conceded hubs may be necessary to kick-start the AFL season.Credit:Getty Images While AFL heavyweights have refused to speculate on a timeline for a possible return to play, decision-makers at headquarters are growing quietly confident games can return in June or July. But with different areas of the country dictating different safety measures to combat COVID-19, there’s no guarantee state governments will uniformly ease restrictions. The AFL is likely to use one, two or three hubs but is taking no chances and will have a back-up plan for every part of Australia. It comes as Geelong champion and players' union president Dangerfield came around to the idea of players quarantining in hubs to kick-start the season. The Brownlow medallist had initially appeared wary of the idea and claimed it would be difficult to sell to all players, particularly those with young families. But, speaking in his weekly radio spot on SEN, Dangerfield said he believed it might be the only way to reignite the season. ""The longer you look at where we are at nationally, in terms of trying to combat the virus, I think it becomes more of an option to start the season,"" he said. ""This is purely my own personal thoughts, (but) I don't see us flying week to week, state to state. ''I don't think that's going to be possible, so I think we're going to have to open our eyes to that possibility that there's certain hubs around.

62,/sport/afl/hubs-to-be-ready-across-the-country-20200421-p54lw7.html,MCG could host up to six games per week when footy returns,"The MCG could stage up to half a dozen AFL matches a week when football returns, and still hopes to host the grand final, as all six states and two territories prepare to host quarantine player hubs. The MCG is central to the league’s plans for a July return, according to stadium sources. MCC chief executive Stuart Fox was unavailable to comment but a spokeswoman said groundstaff had kept the venue in a condition to immediately host multiple games per week once the AFL was given the all clear to resume. Replay   The AFL shutdown has created a looming clash with cricket, although cricket’s season is also up in the air with the Twenty20 World Cup in doubt, and India’s travel plans for a lucrative Test series uncertain. As The Age reported last month, the Melbourne Cricket Club does not yet have a contract with Cricket Australia for the Boxing Day Test but expects to strike an agreement for the event to go ahead at the ’G. The AFL is yet to determine how deep into October, November and potentially December it will need to go, but under its current agreement the AFL would have access to the ground until October 10. It seems all but certain that the AFL will return using a number of hubs, with AFL Players Association president Patrick Dangerfield conceding that a normal return to play appears unlikely. League sources have confirmed to The Age that while all six states are being considered, there will also be plans for the Northern Territory and the ACT to host hubs, should they be required. Patrick Dangerfield has conceded hubs may be necessary to kick-start the AFL season.Credit:Getty Images While AFL heavyweights have refused to speculate on a timeline for a possible return to play, decision-makers at headquarters are growing quietly confident games can return in June or July. But with different areas of the country dictating different safety measures to combat COVID-19, there’s no guarantee state governments will uniformly ease restrictions. The AFL is likely to use one, two or three hubs but is taking no chances and will have a back-up plan for every part of Australia. It comes as Geelong champion and players' union president Dangerfield came around to the idea of players quarantining in hubs to kick-start the season. The Brownlow medallist had initially appeared wary of the idea and claimed it would be difficult to sell to all players, particularly those with young families. But, speaking in his weekly radio spot on SEN, Dangerfield said he believed it might be the only way to reignite the season. ""The longer you look at where we are at nationally, in terms of trying to combat the virus, I think it becomes more of an option to start the season,"" he said. ""This is purely my own personal thoughts, (but) I don't see us flying week to week, state to state. ''I don't think that's going to be possible, so I think we're going to have to open our eyes to that possibility that there's certain hubs around. ""We have to be open to it as the jobs of so many rely upon it and that's not just players ... so as more information comes to light I think it's not as scary a proposition as what first initial reactions were.""

Rock My Wand is having her seventh run in a very busy first preparation but this race looks to have fallen into her lap. Last start the Matthew Smith-trained filly ran home strongly behind Away Game in the group 2 Percy Sykes during The Championships. Punter’s Intelligence shows that she ran the fastest last 600m in the race too, clocking 36.12s to finish alongside See You Soon and Dame Giselle. Has to transfer her wet track form onto a firmer surface but she’s the horse to beat, as the market suggests. 1. Formentera sat outside of the leader and won well at Warwick Farm last start. Should be able to stretch to 1400m and maintains his association with Tim Clark.How to play it: Rock My Wand to win. Newcastle trainer Kris Lees has one eye on the Brisbane carnival with Graff, who tackles Saturday’s Hawkesbury Gold Rush over 1100m at the GardensCredit:AAP Love the way 3. Laure Me In found the line at Warwick Farm last start over the mile having settled last from the wide draw. Punter’s Intelligence shows his 35.77s last-600m split was three lengths faster than the next best while he was the only runner to break 12s the last 200m. When trained by Tony McEvoy the five-year-old won dominantly over 1800m at Flemington (January last year) and Laure Me In looks to be wanting the extra trip now. 4. Shadow Flight overcame being horribly disadvantaged at the weights in the group 3 Neville Sellwood last start to run a bold race and finish a  close-up third to Night’s Watch. The six-year-old is in career best form but jumps up in the ratings  now and is four weeks between runs.How to play it: Laure Me In. 16. Donandkim was trapped wide, shuffled back in the run and blocked in the straight all in the same race last start. That was behind Indy Car and Icebath, the early favourites for the Hawkesbury Guineas. Hoping things are a lot less problematic for the Gerald Ryan-trained three-year-old here. Last preparation, his first for Ryan, he won three from four, with the defeat a game third in the group 3 Spring Stakes at Newcastle behind Asiago. There doesn’t look to be much separating a lot of these horses ability-wise so the map is key and Donandkim should get a lovely run. 5. McCormack was trapped wide in the Provincial Championships Final. Forget that. Had been flying prior and finds Hugh Bowman.How to play it: Donandkim each-way. It’s a far cry from the $20+ we got about 6. Bangkok second and third-up but here we go again with the Allan Denham-trained mare. Drawn barrier 1, expect to see the five-year-old much closer. She isn’t a one-dimensional backmarker. On the five other occasions she has drawn inside she has settled third, second, fifth, seventh and fourth. All three of her runs have been exceptional this time back. First-up she was luckless behind Fasika and I Am Excited before making up a stack of late ground in her last two. This is the last hurrah for two time group1 winner 1. In Her Time. She is also exceptionally well in with 60kg given her lofty benchmark rating. Her runs have been much better than they read on paper.How to play it: Bangkok to win. This appears to be a very targeted preparation with 2. Graff in order to get him winning again ahead of loftier Queensland targets. The four-year-old wouldn’t have been out of place in the group 1 TJ Smith Stakes yet here he is in a listed race with the blinkers going back on having won his most recent Newcastle trial impressively. He has drawn soft and Hugh Bowman rides. Two of Graff’s three wins have been over the Rosehill 1100m. Sure, he carries 59kg but he has the class to overcome that. First-up last preparation he was beaten a length by Redzel and Pierata with Nature Strip and Sunlight back in fourth and fifth. The pattern that has started to emerge with lightning fast mare 15. Agent Pippa is that she responds to being kept fresh. She’ll give a big sight.How to play it: Graff to win. Convinced that 3. Eleven Eleven is the best horse in this race. Just wish he drew a gate. Eleven Eleven’s first up run was a touch hidden with the son of Fastnet Rock running the fastest 600-400 and 400-200 before peaking on his run. The query I’ve got is whether Greg Hickman’s three-year-old is still going to be half a run short, especially straight out to 1400m but last preparation in Queensland highlights how talented he is with three consecutive placings behind Alligator Blood. They were all on good tracks. 4. Bandersnatch smashed the clock first-up last preparation. He’ll roll along in front with the benefit of the inside draw.How to play it: Eleven Eleven. 6. Girl Tuesday didn’t look at all comfortable first up in the wet conditions. Forget she ever ran. Has since been back to the trials with the four weeks between runs and despite running last, love how she trucked through the line. Back on top of the ground, expect her to bounce back in a big way. The five-year-old was outstanding last preparation, bolting in first-up beating Bangkok and Cradle Mountain before finishing alongside Avilius at weight-for-age. This is a lovely race for 16. Live And Free with 53kg on his back but he has always improved sharply second up. However, 1500m first-up and having won a trial recently in the manner of a horse ready to go, perhaps John O’Shea has the five-year-old more forward than in past preparations.How to play it: Girl Tuesday each-way. 13. Nordicus is knocking on the door this time back having savaged the line in two runs. The blueblood gelding (Dundeel x Miss Finland) is now under the care of Anthony Cummings and he has the four-year-old flying. First-up he matched motors with Indy Car over 1100m before staying at 1100m on a heavy track at Warwick Farm. His 35.31s last 600m was the quickest of the entire meeting. That’s despite his earlier form suggesting he wasn’t fond of wet tracks. He jumps into Saturday company here but third up on top of the ground and out to 1300m, he’ll take holding out with any luck from the car park draw. 11. Miss Einstein has won three of her six starts and is a lightly-raced mare worth following.How to play it: Nordicus each-way.

Live And Free bursts away to victory last year.Credit:AAP “As a trainer, you watch jockeys closely and he has reminded me of the jockey that was winning on Racing To Win and Private Steer in the past couple of months,” O’Shea said. “When Glen is riding like that, you want him on your team, you need him on your team, particular when you have 53kg in a race like this. “There are not that many jockeys that can ride 53kg and be as good as he is at the moment.” The rejuvenated Boss has put together a raft of big-race wins since returning to Australia from Singapore, including the The Everest, Golden Eagle, Newmarket and a group 1 double on the final day of The Championships in the Australian Oaks and Sydney Cup. He was one of the first calls O’Shea made when he knew Live And Free would get the limit weight in the Hawkesbury Cup. Live And Free has peaked at this time of year for the past two campaigns.

Live And Free went to the line untested because of traffic problems on both occasions. O'Shea is hoping for a change of luck on Saturday “Both times Glen never found a clear run and it would be fair to say that the owners are hoping it is third time lucky and he gets the right sort of run this time,” O’Shea said. “He should be midfield in the run and hopefully get clear in the straight and have the final crack at them.” Live And Free has had support from $9 to $7.50 in the Hawkesbury Cup where Amangiri is the $5.50 BetEasy favourite.

As the AFL and NRL move carefully in putting plans in place to resume their competitions once they given the all-clear from health authorities, Australia’s governing body for tennis also said it “fully expects” to be one of the first of the professional sports to emerge after the pandemic gloom. Replay   In a year of extraordinary upheaval for global sport, the tennis calendar has a vastly different look with the tennis circuit shut down suddenly in early March, Wimbledon cancelled for the first time since the Second World War and the French Open rescheduled for September. With no guarantee of professional tennis resuming overseas any earlier than July, officials are being forced to rejig. Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley said the governing body started thinking about five weeks ago as to what “an optimal domestic competition” could look like as the country’s leading players face the unusual reality of living through a winter in Australia. He said there were joint priorities of helping Australia’s elite players by playing in a strong competition and engaging the sport’s commercial and broadcast partners by building “some content domestically for our players”. “We’re right in the thick of that and we’ll soon be rolling it out,” Tiley told The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. John Millman has advocated for a domestic tennis competition during the sport's shutdown due to coronavirus.Credit:Joe Armao “We’ve got one competition which we’re going to be announcing and rolling out and, who knows, it may become a new normal for us at that time of the year, which could be pretty cool.” Australia’s third-highest-ranked men’s player John Millman was among those advocating for and pushing Tennis Australia to introduce a domestic competition – a state-of-origin type concept involving current and former players – but the path in which Tennis Australia goes down in 2020 remains unclear. ""If Australia recovers before ATP tour is ready to kick off again I think we have a unique opportunity in our sport to create domestic interest in tennis again,"" Millman tweeted this month. ""Instead of having your run of the mill money tournaments imagine something completely different. How about an interstate teams competition?” While Tiley is confident tennis will be among the first of the professional sports to recommence as soon as practicable, he reiterated that they would abide by all government directions. “We have to wait for a lot of those restrictions to be lifted before going with something that we could actually roll out,” Tiley said. “But we’re excited. ""It’s great that John and other players have ideas.” Tiley also said the ease for the sport to abide by social distancing rules worked in its favour. “We’re fortunate that because we’re a sport that you can practice social distance and isolation and still compete, because you’re so far from your opponent,” he said. “You can switch sides of the court by going [a different] side from the net … and be pretty far from your opponent. “We do have that luxury when it comes to the sport of tennis, and we’ll certainly use it.” Despite the shutdown of state borders, Tennis Australia is likely to have the flexibility to take any domestic competition to a range of locations across Australia. “We’ve also got to be mindful we’re going into winter.

I've had a few,"" Frank Sinatra famously sang. And that was certainly the case for me on a biting Sunday afternoon in New York in March 1998. I had started a four-month stint at the New York Post - at that point I was in general news before crossing to the sports department to help cover the NBA. As it happened, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls were in town to face the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. It was likely to be - and turned out to be - Jordan's last game as a Bull at his beloved venue, and one that he had tormented his old mate Patrick Ewing in so many times through a heated Bulls-Knicks rivalry. I had to get a ticket. The Post's sports editor couldn't help me, and the MSG ticket office had long sold out. Remember, this was well before StubHub and SeatGeek, so my only hope was to scalp a ticket on the Sunday before the afternoon game. Unfortunately, I forgot one thing. To set my alarm. A big Saturday night would turn into a lather of panic come Sunday afternoon when I awoke and switched on the television ... halfway through the damn game. Jordan put up 42 points in a 102-89 win, complete with a back-to-the-basket scoop in the lane that would be on all the back pages the following morning. He also went retro, donning his original Air Jordan shoes from 1985, an ode to a building he had described as the ""mecca of basketball"". So as sports lovers, and even those with only a passing interest in basketball, turn back the clock and tune in to The Last Dance - a 10-part, ESPN documentary of the Jordan Bulls and their final run of 1997-98, aired on Netflix locally - that's one memory I won't forget in a hurry. Replay   Fortunately, I had been at MSG for the All-Star game, in what had been billed as the passing of the torch from Jordan to a young Kobe Bryant (although just being around the legendary Larry Bird, then coaching, was as much a highlight), and I later was at the now-defunct Meadowlands Arena to help cover the first-round play-off series between the Nets and Bulls. If you thought any morsel of detail now on a Lance Franklin or Dustin Martin was big news, the need for a Jordan headline was in a higher stratosphere. There was no bigger figure in world sport, let alone the NBA. The newspaper wars in NYC at the time were intense, particularly between Murdoch's Post and rival tabloid, the Daily News. Egos were huge, papers were thick, there were rolling editions and all quotes - often already professionally transcribed at games - were closely read to shape a story. Miss a yarn, and it was major trouble. Just ask the Post's New York Mets' beat reporter at the time who was beaten to the story of Mike Piazza's trade from the Florida Marlins, and was berated so loudly behind closed doors it surely was heard during peak hour on Park Avenue. I experienced something similar when covering the corresponding series between the Knicks and Bird's Indiana Pacers. I had gone to the Pacers' dressing room briefly, only to be, shall I say, reminded by the chief Knicks reporter when I got back to the Knicks' dressing room that I should not have left without asking, for every Knick had to be spoken to. NBA players were regularly available for the media at morning shootaround, later in the evening until 45 minutes from tip-off, and post-game. Jordan and Scottie Pippen would always speak after  matches but not necessarily earlier. Pre-game at the Meadowlands, Dennis Rodman had his earphones on and was glued to watching vision of the Nets on a small television screen. Fair to say, he wasn't up for a word. Luc Longley was welcoming to a fellow Australian voice after shootaround and called me into a small room adjoining the dressingroom for a chat about life with ""Da Bulls"". ""I won't be forgetting this in a hurry,"" he said . Steve Kerr, now in charge of a dynasty of his own, in this case the Golden State Warriors, was also up for a word. Later that night, the Bulls having completed a series sweep, there was barely a seat available for Jordan's post-game media conference. Typically, he wore a sharp suit, all part of what was by then a finely crafted image. At the time, we were all dumbfounded as to why Bulls general manager Jerry Krause - and ego - would be allowed within two months to break this team and dynasty up. Yes, the squad was ageing, but why not just continue to refresh around coach Phil Jackson, Jordan and Pippen until they were finally dethroned? There was no reason to suggest they wouldn't have won a fourth straight title - and Jordan's seventh - the following season, the shortened lock-out campaign almost certainly helping them. Regrets? Surely Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, in revisiting The Last Dance and without a championship since, has a few. Episodes three and four of The Last Dance will air on Monday on Netflix.

For months, the national champion quarterback from LSU was linked with Cincinnati. The Bengals began the draft by sending the name of the Heisman Trophy winner to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in the basement of his home. This digital/remote/virtual draft was up and running. LSU quarterback Joe Burrow, in his lounge room, was taken as pick No.1 in the NFL draft.Credit:NFL Burrow, the third straight Heisman Trophy winner taken with the first overall selection, joins a team that went 2-14 in 2019 under first-year head coach Zac Taylor. The Bengals scored 279 points last season, third worst in the league, and also ranked 30th in total offence. The previous time Cincinnati grabbed a Heisman quarterback to open the draft, it was Southern California’s Carson Palmer in 2003. There were no fireworks on the Las Vegas Strip. No bear hug between Goodell and Burrow; the commissioner said he would miss those, even if his body won’t. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced draft picks from his basement.Credit:Getty Images The most basic of selection meetings, organised in this manner due to the coronavirus pandemic, has team personnel making picks from their homes. And players learning their future employers in their homes. ‘‘I do believe this draft is going to be the most memorable we have ever had,’’ said Goodell. ‘‘We need to make sure that we’re doing things safely and put public safety No.1, but we also need to carry on. We need to make sure that we’re prepared when we come out of this to be in a position to start our season on time and play our season.’’ Normalcy, at least among the picks, was the order of the early evening. First came Burrow. In his spectacular senior season, he threw for 60 touchdowns with only six interceptions and the Tigers beat six top-10 teams on their way to the national title. ‘‘To jump up to No.1 overall is crazy to me,’’ Burrow said. ‘‘But it’s a dream come true. I wasn’t very good my junior year. I worked really hard to get better, my guys worked really hard to get better, and we jelled as a team.’’ Ohio State defensive end Chase Young was the second pick to Washington Redskins, while Young’s teammate, cornerback Jeff Okudah, went No.3 to Detroit Lions.

78,/sport/nfl/bengals-take-quarterback-burrow-at-no-1-in-nfl-draft-20200424-p54mvs.html,Bengals take quarterback Burrow at No.1 in NFL draft,"In the most unique of NFL drafts, filled with technological concerns and even uncertainty when real football might return, there was one constant on Friday - Joe Burrow. For months, the national champion quarterback from LSU was linked with Cincinnati. The Bengals began the draft by sending the name of the Heisman Trophy winner to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in the basement of his home. This digital/remote/virtual draft was up and running. LSU quarterback Joe Burrow, in his lounge room, was taken as pick No.1 in the NFL draft.Credit:NFL Burrow, the third straight Heisman Trophy winner taken with the first overall selection, joins a team that went 2-14 in 2019 under first-year head coach Zac Taylor. The Bengals scored 279 points last season, third worst in the league, and also ranked 30th in total offence. The previous time Cincinnati grabbed a Heisman quarterback to open the draft, it was Southern California’s Carson Palmer in 2003. There were no fireworks on the Las Vegas Strip. No bear hug between Goodell and Burrow; the commissioner said he would miss those, even if his body won’t. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced draft picks from his basement.Credit:Getty Images The most basic of selection meetings, organised in this manner due to the coronavirus pandemic, has team personnel making picks from their homes. And players learning their future employers in their homes. ‘‘I do believe this draft is going to be the most memorable we have ever had,’’ said Goodell. ‘‘We need to make sure that we’re doing things safely and put public safety No.1, but we also need to carry on. We need to make sure that we’re prepared when we come out of this to be in a position to start our season on time and play our season.’’ Normalcy, at least among the picks, was the order of the early evening.

The NBL, WNBL, Basketball Australia and all state and territory associations have committed to work together with the taskforce to manage the financial pain being felt across the sport, advise on how to seek government support and develop a recovery plan for when organised basketball can return to the floor. Kings captain Kevin Lisch and Shea Ili of Melbourne United.Credit:AAP NBL owner Larry Kestelman and BA chief executive Ned Coten will lead the taskforce which will include basketball representatives Allan Yates, Nicola Ellis, Tony Hallam, Jacob Holmes, Brian Delaney and Jerril Rechter along with independent business figures Ruffy Geminder, Diane Smith-Gander and Rickard Gardell. The panel met for the first time last week and are due to meet again next week. Both the NBL and WNBL are anticipating significantly less revenue from sponsors next season. They will both be severely hurt financially should large gatherings still be outlawed as both leagues draw a large share of their revenue from home games and sponsors while making very little from broadcast money. At a state level, governing bodies and local clubs have seen almost all their revenue disappear from social basketball and state league play as all forms of the sport have been shut down during the pandemic with no return date known. Kestelman said many parts of the sport would need government support to cover for the loss of revenue. ""Unlike other sports, basketball leagues do not derive the bulk of their revenue from broadcast agreements,"" Kestelman said. ""With a significant amount of Australian homes now having a basketball hoop in the backyard, the sport can play a crucial role in getting the country active and back to normal, but we need help more than ever. ""Under the restrictions imposed by COVID-19, the sport has come to standstill for now. ""This includes not just the NBL and WNBL but also Australia’s premier winter league NBL1, the 3X3 Hustle and all community and grassroots leagues right around the country."" Kestelman has already had talks with federal Sports Minister Richard Colbeck to push the case for basketball to not be forgotten when other sports are assisted. ""The NBL attracted almost one million people last season and is now widely considered the second- best domestic basketball league in the world after the NBA. We are an entertainment product built for live attendances,"" Kestelman said. ""Unlike other codes, basketball cannot fall back on revenue from television if restrictions are still in place to crowds and would need assistance. ""We are not seeking special priority but rather simply asking not to be forgotten to ensure we can continue to deliver the sport that we and so many Australians love."" Coten said basketball as a whole employed and assisted thousands of people around Australia and the sport needed to be there for people when organised sport returned. ""The game employs tens of thousands of people across the country and generates significant economic impact as well as a range of health and social benefits for the wider community across both genders and all ages that will be needed more than ever as we recover,"" Coten said.
