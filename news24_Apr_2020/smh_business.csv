Wealth manager Australian Ethical, which has $3.8 billion under management, is seeking clarity from the ASX- listed biotech giant on how it will manage the level and frequency of donation payments, at a time when unemployment is ramping up in the US. Plasma collection is a ""moral maze"" and the ethics are about to be front and centre, warn Credit Suisse analysts. Credit:Penny Stephens The head of ethics at Australian Ethical, Stuart Palmer, said while paying for plasma wasn't in itself unethical, there were concerns that some people may suffer harm from making frequent donations in order to earn money. ""The key concern is that some vulnerable people can suffer harm from giving plasma. This is particularly relevant in a time of increasing unemployment and under-employment where people are looking for supplementary income."" The US supplies the majority of the world's plasma and donors are paid for their blood, with payments usually starting at around $US50 ($90) per collection. The majority of plasma sourced by CSL comes from the US. The concerns raised by Australian Ethical come in the wake of a research note from Credit Suisse last week that warned CSL would have to closely manage the health and welfare of donors, suggesting the collections sector was in for increased scrutiny over how it treats donors. ""The principal risk is reputational. That is to say that CSL [would be] potentially mired in accusations of exploitation,"" the note said. It also warned that the sector's reliance on donors from low-socioeconomic backgrounds was attracting attention and that CSL's planned new donation centres ""have an even higher propensity than the industry average to be located in regions where the local population are more economically vulnerable to exploitation."" CSL chief medical officer Dr Charmaine Gittleson said there were no ethical or health concerns associated with blood plasma donation, saying it was in CSL's best interests to ensure the ongoing health of donors and there were no large long-term studies linking health risks to frequent donations. ""We have 48 million donations happening each year and every plasma centre is monitoring them for safety. All of that information gets collected and put into formal systems. Regulators are able to look at data across the years and are able to track the safety of donations,"" she said. ""And we have not seen any significant regulatory changes to how [plasma] is collected."" Australian Ethical's Palmer said the Credit Suisse report had raised pertinent issues for CSL to address. ""The research does raise important industry concerns about the frequency of permitted donations, how much donors are paid and companies’ responsibility for understanding health impacts on regular donors and having appropriate processes in place to prevent risky donations."" ""Payment levels should take account of the value and profitability of the plasma products being created. These are issues we intend to discuss further with CSL."" Valued at $139 billion, CSL is one of the most valuable companies on the ASX, largely because of growth in its blood plasma therapy business. It collects plasma, the yellow liquid in blood which carries cells and proteins, and turns it into life saving therapies. CSL has been updating investors on the rollout of new centres over the past year to cater for global growing demand for plasma products. One industry expert said those sites were likely chosen where zoning regulations were favourable and there was good access to public transport. In response to concerns raised in the Credit Suisse report, CSL said plasma donors understood and appreciated their role in delivering life-altering therapies and that ethics and regulatory safety were the company's number one focus. CSL is a member of industry groups including the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association, which is currently undertaking a longitudinal study of donor health. ""The consequence of incomplete or inaccurate reporting on this subject can risk the health of many around the world who live with rare, serious and life-threatening conditions."" The Credit Suisse report also raised the spectre of new regulations around how migrant donors contribute plasma, which could limit or make it more expensive for donors to cross the border from Mexico to come to centres operated by CSL's. Credit Suisse believes the company has a 5 per cent exposure to Mexican donors. CSL chief executive Paul Perreault. Credit:Eamon Gallagher One industry expert said CSL would be in the box seat if the sector faced tighter regulation, because its governance practices were already best in class. Unlike other players in the US market, CSL has more consistent internal systems for collection and donor monitoring and would be ready to move faster than competitors to roll out new requirements, they said. Australian equities analysts have questioned whether the company can collect enough plasma in the coming months to offset slowdowns caused by coronavirus shutdowns. Citi and JP Morgan have both said that because there is a delay between the collection and sale of plasma products, the true impact of pandemic shutdowns on CSL are not yet known. On an investor call to discuss COVID-19 earlier this month, management were asked how they were encouraging donations and whether they anticipated the price they pay to donors would go up or down given rising unemployment. CSL chief executive Paul Perreault said the company was ""pulling all levers"" to encourage donations, though it was impossible to predict whether the amount on offer to donors would change. ""I don't know, I can't tell you. It all depends on what happens,"" he said. Emma is the small business reporter for The Age and Sydney Morning Herald based in Melbourne.

2,/business/companies/the-week-that-virgin-australia-hit-the-ground-hard-20200423-p54mhp.html,The week that Virgin Australia hit the ground hard,"It was getting close to 8pm on Thursday night when Paul Scurrah finally accepted the airline he leads was unlikely to avoid financial collapse.  The Virgin Australia chief executive was attending a virtual meeting inside the makeshift office in his Brisbane home when bad news filtered through from Canberra. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had used a television interview to declare a fix to the airline's woes was at hand. It was not the type of solution Scurrah had been holding out for. Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah after announcing the company had gone into administration on Tuesday.Credit:Louise Kennerley Morrison said his government would not get in the way of a ""commercial solution"" to save Australia's second airline as it teetered on the brink of collapse. ""And there are many things going on there,” the Prime Minister said. It was the first time the Virgin camp had heard of a fix that did not involve at least some taxpayers' cash. The interview was a clear message that after weeks of back and forth, any hope of government support was shot. Australia's second airline went into voluntary administration on Monday, a move that adds to the uncertainty for its 10,000 employees, many of whom have been stood down during the coronavirus pandemic, and could change the face of aviation in this country.  The government's decision to let Virgin slide into administration has set off a multibillion-dollar race for control of the airline involving some of the nation's most powerful dealmakers and deepest-pocketed investors. It has already pitted state governments against each other. BGH Capital, the private equity firm led by well-connected dealmakers Ben Gray and Robin Bishop is the highest-profile investment firm in the race.  Transport billionaire and airport owner Linsday Fox is also eyeing the airline, along with various international investors. Yet while many potential buyers are circling Virgin, the government's decision is not without political risk. Administration, a mechanism designed to allow a company to survive while also clawing back money for lenders, can be messy, as other high-profile corporate implosions such as Network Ten show. The appointment of former Macquarie chief Nicholas Moore as an emissary for Morrison in the proceedings suggests the government is well aware of this and that it may end up being the buyer of last resort anyway. Morrison had repeatedly signalled in recent weeks that there would be no Virgin bailout. The government did not want to set a precedent that would prompt other challenged companies to seek assistance. Nor did it like the politics of being seen to support Virgin's foreign shareholders, which include aviation giants Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. But the Prime Minister's announcement on Thursday still came as a shock to those at Virgin who had been hanging on to hopes of support. A clip of the comment was quickly sent around to Scurrah and other senior managers, sparking a flurry of messages and phone calls. Replay   Virgin's management, board and bankers been working feverishly to restructure the group, weighed down with $6.8 billion in debt, so it could survive the coronavirus pandemic. Sources close to the survival project run by investment banks Houlihan Lokey and UBS and reporting to chairman Elizabeth Bryan say Virgin had attracted nine different parties who were looking at deals to keep the airline alive. However all of the proposals hinged on some level of government support. Scurrah, in the job for only 13 months, first wrote to Morrison on March 26 asking him for ""urgent support"" in the form of a $1.4 billion loan facility. Knocked back, the long-time transport and logistics executive returned with eight further proposals, the final one being for just $200 million he was convinced would buy Virgin enough time to finalise a solvent restructuring deal. Some observers believe Team Virgin should have realised its proposals were going nowhere. ""If you tell even a small child they can't have any chocolate seven times you have to question their intelligence when they come back again,"" said one senior banker. Still, despite the government signalling early on it would not provide financial support to specific companies, the Virgin camp believed there were encouraging signs and held out hope. But the switch in rhetoric from considering ""all options"" to ensure Australia retained two airlines (albeit with an assurance taxpayers would not ""bail out"" Virgin's foreign owners), to there being a ""commercial solution"" signalled that was over. Sources who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters said that in later talks, Morrison's office encouraged Virgin to talk to BGH. There is also a view within the Virgin camp that BGH's interest gave the government confidence it did not need to come to its assistance. “BGH came to Virgin through the government,” said one source with knowledge of the events. ""They’re very close to the government and were very clear and aggressive and saying: 'you don’t need to do anything, we’ll pick it up'."" The firm had sniffed around Virgin weeks earlier and had spoken to key figures at the airline including Scurrah and Bryan. But the two camps were at loggerheads about how the deal would be structured financially. One critic of Virgin, speaking on condition of anonymity, says the airline should have engaged more enthusiastically with BGH and other private suitors earlier. ""People were told to structure bids in a way that assumed [Virgin's] balance sheet was OK when it clearly wasn't,"" he said. ""The company is losing hundreds of millions of dollars."" Others question the view BGH had any influence over the government's decision and describe Virgin's reaction as ""sour grapes"". They argue there was no chance Morrison would open the floodgates to other bailouts by helping the airline. They also point out the only party that clearly put pressure on the government was rival Qantas, whose chief executive Alan Joyce has said Virgin should not be rewarded for years of mismanagement. Qantas had also asked the government to proportionally match any support it gave Virgin to ""even the playing field"". At 2.15am on Sunday morning BGH signed confidentiality agreements with Virgin, giving the buyout firm access to its data room to inspect its books. BGH has $2.6 billion in it coffers and is working with heavy-hitting Melbourne lawyer Leon Zwier and outgoing PwC boss Luke Sayers. It is also backed by the nation's largest super fund, AustralianSuper, which manages $180 billion in retirement savings and is linked to the trade union movement. Former ACTU director Dave Oliver is a director. The BGH consortium is one of 11 groups Virgin's administrators say are interested in buying and relaunching the airline. Deloitte partner and Virgin administrator Vaughan Strawbridge hopes to find a new owner within three months. Buyout firms Bain Capital, Apollo and Oaktree are also said to be interested. So is US airline investor Indigo Partners, which owns a number of budget airlines across the Americas and Europe, including Frontier Airlines and Wizz Air, and which Virgin has approached in the past about becoming an investor, according to a source with knowledge of those conversations. State governments could also play a role in determining Virgin's future, with Queensland putting $200 million on the table and declaring it will ""stop at nothing"" to keep the airline in Brisbane, and NSW and Victoria expressing an interest in luring it south. Linsday Fox, who is close to Sayers, discussed a plan to bring Virgin to his privately-owned Avalon airport with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. Virgin first opened its data room three weeks ago so its major shareholders could consider recapitalising the business. The only one who came close was co-founder and 10 per cent shareholder Richard Branson. Observers note he had the most to lose from Virgin's collapse: the licence fees he gets for the Virgin brand, suggested to be worth around $15 million to $25 million a year. At a board meeting on Monday, Virgin's directors made the unenviable decision to appoint Deloitte as administrators. That firm was chosen a little over two weeks earlier at another meeting where there was mild disagreement about which group was best to advise the ailing airline. Sources aware of the selection process said the board of Virgin favoured KordaMentha, given its success with administrations with large unionised workforces, while Scurrah favoured  PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Unable to make a decision, they threw to CFO Keith Neate, who went for  Deloitte. Many in the Virgin camp are riled by the Morrison government's mantra that it did not want to bail out Virgin's foreign shareholders. They say every deal they put forward involved these shareholders being wiped out by an injection of new equity. Their backs are also up over how much money the government has given to Regional Express Airlines, believing the mostly foreign-owned company chaired by former Nationals leader John Sharp has received the lion's share of almost $300 million in assistance to the regional aviation industry. “If Virgin had been given that and a government guarantee, it may well have been able to do a solvent restructuring,” said one figure close to the events. Transport Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack's assistance package of $715 million in waived fees and levies for Virgin and Qantas appears to have made little impact at a time when they are barely flying. Virgin sources said it received the first $4 million cash injection from the program on Friday. At the same time, some investment banking sources (who declined to be named to maintain business relationships) were surprised that Virgin appeared to only be considering a rescue deal that included the government or administration and did not consider a debt-for-equity swap to rescue the company outside of administration, a mechanism used by Nine Entertainment and Slater & Gordon in the past. ""I couldn't even get them to return my call,"" said one senior investment banker. Many industry watchers now see administration as a chance for the loss-making Virgin to improve its business by ripping up bad contracts and shaking off unsustainable debts. But forces at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Morrison government could play a key role in determining whether that happens. Federal Labor and unions wanted the government to bail Virgin out to protect jobs and save the nation from a potential Qantas monopoly. Governments in America and across Europe have already extended billions of dollars in financial aid to their airlines as the pandemic forced them to ground operations. The Australian Council of Trade Unions will arrange representation for Virgin's 10,000 workers, who are owed $450 million in wages, leave and other entitlements. This could make them a decisive voting bloc when it comes to any rescue deal. ACTU president Michele O'Neil said the peak union body would support deals that were in the best interests of workers - which meant saving as many jobs as possible in a relaunched airline. The unions would support ""a buyer that has a viable plan for the long-term future for Virgin airlines, not a short term take-the-money-and-run proposal,"" she said. Meanwhile the holders of Virgin's $1.8 billion of junk bonds are concerned they will be asked to take a much larger haircut on what they are owed than Virgin's secured creditors - banks and aircraft lessors - and say they are ""up for a fight"". “This is not going to be as simple as everyone’s saying, and done and dusted in two or three weeks,"" said one investment banker.

4,/business/the-economy/australia-s-china-challenge-in-the-post-coronavirus-world-20200422-p54mbp.html,Australia's China challenge in the post-coronavirus world,"The coronavirus was a health story. It is now an economic story. Before we know it, it will become a geo-strategic story and Australia has a blind spot. There are two major challenges Australia must face as it navigates a post-coronavirus world which will be dominated by the US retreat from its sphere of influence and China’s increasingly muscular diplomacy. The first is our lack of direct access to China. There are few, if any, MPs in Parliament who have a relationship with their Chinese counterpart. How does Australia navigate the geo-strategic environment of the post-coronavirus world? Credit:Matt Davidson Australian MPs can count substantial networks in Washington, London and Jakarta, but none with the National People’s Congress of our largest trading partner. Half-a-dozen offices in Parliament have a sticker of wolf claw marks on their front window. They belong to the Parliamentary Friends of Democracy - an informal group made up of Liberal senators James Paterson and Amanda Stoker, Labor’s Kimberley Kitching and the chair and deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Andrew Hastie and Anthony Byrne. The stickers are a statement. A direct response to the Chinese Communist Party's increasingly assertive “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” that has seen it attempt to buy political capital in Australia, take aggressive steps in the Pacific, exchange barbs with the United States and wield influence over the World Health Organisation. These are legitimate concerns about a country accused of judicial and human rights violations from the Muslim ""re-education"" camps in Xinjiang to Hong Kong democracy protesters. So too are the allegations of negligence and cover-up in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, which this week filtered down to the local council level when Wagga Wagga, NSW, threatened to sever its twin city relationship Kunming, China. The stasis now goes right to the top. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is one of the few G20 leaders not to have direct contact with China’s President Xi Jinping since the coronavirus outbreak. In this context, it is worth considering if Australia is getting the best seat it can at a rapidly changing diplomatic table.

One prioritises security, the other economics, within the one government department. “China might have got us into this crisis but it is also the country most likely to lead us out of it,” Jane Golley, the director of the Australian National University’s China and the World Centre told the Centre for Economic Development this week. “There is a real need to strike a better balance than we have in the past.” KPMG's head of Asia and international markets Doug Ferguson said Australia wants to find growth areas in other markets.

Labor has called for a bipartisan China committee that would mark objectives and make policy.

It would deliver a plan to deal with a country that by 2035 will likely become the world’s largest economy.

The Pacific, which has developed at a slower rate than anywhere else in the world for the past decade, is similarly exposed. In this space, Australia is in a relatively unique position.

Beijing accused Canberra of political maneuvering and ideological bias. “It will disrupt international cooperation in fighting the pandemic and goes against people's shared aspiration,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday night. No doubt it was political. Expect Australia to go further. With the exception of East Timor, Australia has played a largely reactive role in the region, comforted by US hegemony, bobbing like a cork in an ocean of strategic interests.

It is now an economic story. Before we know it, it will become a geo-strategic story and Australia has a blind spot. There are two major challenges Australia must face as it navigates a post-coronavirus world which will be dominated by the US retreat from its sphere of influence and China’s increasingly muscular diplomacy. The first is our lack of direct access to China. There are few, if any, MPs in Parliament who have a relationship with their Chinese counterpart. How does Australia navigate the geo-strategic environment of the post-coronavirus world? Credit:Matt Davidson Australian MPs can count substantial networks in Washington, London and Jakarta, but none with the National People’s Congress of our largest trading partner. Half-a-dozen offices in Parliament have a sticker of wolf claw marks on their front window. They belong to the Parliamentary Friends of Democracy - an informal group made up of Liberal senators James Paterson and Amanda Stoker, Labor’s Kimberley Kitching and the chair and deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Andrew Hastie and Anthony Byrne. The stickers are a statement. A direct response to the Chinese Communist Party's increasingly assertive “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” that has seen it attempt to buy political capital in Australia, take aggressive steps in the Pacific, exchange barbs with the United States and wield influence over the World Health Organisation. These are legitimate concerns about a country accused of judicial and human rights violations from the Muslim ""re-education"" camps in Xinjiang to Hong Kong democracy protesters.

8,/business/banking-and-finance/amp-faces-an-investor-revolt-over-excessive-remuneration-package-20200424-p54n2i.html,AMP faces an investor revolt over 'excessive' remuneration package,"Two years after AMP shareholders hit the wealth manager with one of the biggest investor revolts against a remuneration report, the embattled company is shaping up for a fresh strike at its annual meeting on May 8. Three proxy advisers, CGI Glass Lewis, Ownership Matters and ISS, have lined up to recommend shareholders reject the report, describing the remuneration package as “excessive”, “far too generous” and “allows executives to receive significant wealth if AMP substantially underperforms peers”. It is a damning assessment that suggests the company took a ham-fisted approach to selling the package to investors and the trifecta of proxy advisers. To stop the strike it will need to do some swift talking ahead of the AGM. AMP CEO Francesco De FerrariCredit:Janie Barrett For now it is resolute that the size and hurdles attached to the remuneration package are reasonable given the challenges facing chief executive Francesco De Ferrari and his senior executive team as they embark on a three-year transformation strategy. AMP has a big retail investor base and so some direction on its dividend, particularly given the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA) recent directive to the banks about dividends, will help. In a statement, an AMP spokesman said: “In developing the 2019 remuneration framework, performance hurdles and conditions attached, the board considered the exceptional circumstances facing the business. The remuneration structure has been designed to reflect the scale, complexity and challenge in AMP’s transformation.” But the jury is out on the transformation strategy. And while everyone agrees De Ferrari has a big job in front of him, he is being paid well. His total fixed pay of $3.9 million is more than double the median for an ASX 20-50 CEO of $1.76 million and the total remuneration package of $13.4 million is almost three times the ASX 20-50 median of $5 million, according to CGI Glass’s report. At issue is the awards are structured in such a way that the long-term incentive award is set at between 4.5 times and 5 times fixed pay for most senior executives. Another concern is the performance hurdles are weak. We also find the double long-term incentive granted to the CEO [Francesco De Ferrari] to be excessive.” To put it into perspective, the hurdles are such that half the awards will vest even if AMP underperforms by 10 per cent its peer index and 75 per cent will vest if its performance is in line with that of a peer ASX100 financial services index. As CGI Glass said in its report: “That the awards vest for total shareholder returns performance below the benchmark index total shareholder return (TSR) performance compounds our concerns as to these awards. We also find the double long-term incentive granted to the CEO [Francesco De Ferrari] to be excessive in a year when he has been provided with so much value as a result of amending his sign-on awards.” Ownership Matters says the value of the allocation to six AMP executives excluding the acting CFO was $28.6 million and was almost $65 million across all participants. “Shareholders should also note that as AMP no longer seeks shareholder approval for its CEO’s equity incentives the only way to register opposition to the structure of the transformation incentive is to vote against the remuneration report,” Ownership Matters says. Such profound concerns about the amount and structure of the remuneration package relating to transformation incentives isn’t a good look for a company that has performed so poorly for its shareholders in recent years. In the past five years AMP’s share price has fallen from $6 a share to close at $1.30 on Friday. Nor is it morale building for the rest of the company including some of its advisers who have been reeling over changes in  Buyer of Last Resort (BOLR) arrangements, set out as part of its transformation strategy. De Ferrari joined AMP as fresh blood in January 2019 to try and repair its battered reputation after some shocking revelations during the 2018 royal commission, including charging its clients fees-for-no-service and lying to the regulator on multiple occasions. The scandal resulted in a series of class actions, huge profit falls and massive fund outflows. During the royal commission, billions of dollars was transferred from AMP’s super funds to industry funds. But De Ferrari's strategy is far from foolproof. Indeed one of its key divisions, the Australian Wealth Management division, has been on a downward trend for more than six years. The only source of net inflows is its North product, which is the company’s lowest margin product. All its other products, which charge higher fees, had outflows. This was a problem for AMP long before the global pandemic. Its latest results released on Thursday are a continuation of that trend, with the company recording a $1.9 billion net cash outflow in the March 2020 quarter. To fix the problem will require a sizeable reduction in fees in the other products, which would require a significant growth to offset the decline. De Ferrari also needs to complete the sale of AMP Life business to Resolution Life for $3 billion. The market was told a month ago that it was confident the sale would proceed at a target date of June 30. It hasn’t backed away from this. Despite this, some investors said they were concerned it could be delayed and that would result in capital issues and a possible further renegotiated sale price. AMP is also exposed to the risk of a further blowout in its customer remediation provisions which stood at $652 million at the end of 2019, given the banks have continually ratcheted up the size of their provisions for customer remediation. In the past year banks have put aside an estimated $6 billion in remediation costs. Given it has one of the biggest army of advisers, it wouldn't be a stretch to see it lift its provisions to between $2 billion and $3 billion. For now, it isn’t budging on its provisions. With so many challenges, the board and its investor relations team will have their work cut out trying to convince shareholders not to vote against its remuneration package.

10,/business/companies/the-week-that-virgin-australia-hit-the-ground-hard-20200423-p54mhp.html,The week that Virgin Australia hit the ground hard,"It was getting close to 8pm on Thursday night when Paul Scurrah finally accepted the airline he leads was unlikely to avoid financial collapse.  The Virgin Australia chief executive was attending a virtual meeting inside the makeshift office in his Brisbane home when bad news filtered through from Canberra. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had used a television interview to declare a fix to the airline's woes was at hand. It was not the type of solution Scurrah had been holding out for. Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah after announcing the company had gone into administration on Tuesday.Credit:Louise Kennerley Morrison said his government would not get in the way of a ""commercial solution"" to save Australia's second airline as it teetered on the brink of collapse. ""And there are many things going on there,” the Prime Minister said. It was the first time the Virgin camp had heard of a fix that did not involve at least some taxpayers' cash. The interview was a clear message that after weeks of back and forth, any hope of government support was shot. Australia's second airline went into voluntary administration on Monday, a move that adds to the uncertainty for its 10,000 employees, many of whom have been stood down during the coronavirus pandemic, and could change the face of aviation in this country.  The government's decision to let Virgin slide into administration has set off a multibillion-dollar race for control of the airline involving some of the nation's most powerful dealmakers and deepest-pocketed investors. It has already pitted state governments against each other. BGH Capital, the private equity firm led by well-connected dealmakers Ben Gray and Robin Bishop is the highest-profile investment firm in the race.  Transport billionaire and airport owner Linsday Fox is also eyeing the airline, along with various international investors. Yet while many potential buyers are circling Virgin, the government's decision is not without political risk. Administration, a mechanism designed to allow a company to survive while also clawing back money for lenders, can be messy, as other high-profile corporate implosions such as Network Ten show. The appointment of former Macquarie chief Nicholas Moore as an emissary for Morrison in the proceedings suggests the government is well aware of this and that it may end up being the buyer of last resort anyway. Morrison had repeatedly signalled in recent weeks that there would be no Virgin bailout. The government did not want to set a precedent that would prompt other challenged companies to seek assistance. Nor did it like the politics of being seen to support Virgin's foreign shareholders, which include aviation giants Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. But the Prime Minister's announcement on Thursday still came as a shock to those at Virgin who had been hanging on to hopes of support. A clip of the comment was quickly sent around to Scurrah and other senior managers, sparking a flurry of messages and phone calls. Replay   Virgin's management, board and bankers been working feverishly to restructure the group, weighed down with $6.8 billion in debt, so it could survive the coronavirus pandemic. Sources close to the survival project run by investment banks Houlihan Lokey and UBS and reporting to chairman Elizabeth Bryan say Virgin had attracted nine different parties who were looking at deals to keep the airline alive. However all of the proposals hinged on some level of government support. Scurrah, in the job for only 13 months, first wrote to Morrison on March 26 asking him for ""urgent support"" in the form of a $1.4 billion loan facility. Knocked back, the long-time transport and logistics executive returned with eight further proposals, the final one being for just $200 million he was convinced would buy Virgin enough time to finalise a solvent restructuring deal. Some observers believe Team Virgin should have realised its proposals were going nowhere. ""If you tell even a small child they can't have any chocolate seven times you have to question their intelligence when they come back again,"" said one senior banker. Still, despite the government signalling early on it would not provide financial support to specific companies, the Virgin camp believed there were encouraging signs and held out hope. But the switch in rhetoric from considering ""all options"" to ensure Australia retained two airlines (albeit with an assurance taxpayers would not ""bail out"" Virgin's foreign owners), to there being a ""commercial solution"" signalled that was over. Sources who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters said that in later talks, Morrison's office encouraged Virgin to talk to BGH. There is also a view within the Virgin camp that BGH's interest gave the government confidence it did not need to come to its assistance. “BGH came to Virgin through the government,” said one source with knowledge of the events. ""They’re very close to the government and were very clear and aggressive and saying: 'you don’t need to do anything, we’ll pick it up'."" The firm had sniffed around Virgin weeks earlier and had spoken to key figures at the airline including Scurrah and Bryan. But the two camps were at loggerheads about how the deal would be structured financially. One critic of Virgin, speaking on condition of anonymity, says the airline should have engaged more enthusiastically with BGH and other private suitors earlier. ""People were told to structure bids in a way that assumed [Virgin's] balance sheet was OK when it clearly wasn't,"" he said. ""The company is losing hundreds of millions of dollars."" Others question the view BGH had any influence over the government's decision and describe Virgin's reaction as ""sour grapes"". They argue there was no chance Morrison would open the floodgates to other bailouts by helping the airline. They also point out the only party that clearly put pressure on the government was rival Qantas, whose chief executive Alan Joyce has said Virgin should not be rewarded for years of mismanagement. Qantas had also asked the government to proportionally match any support it gave Virgin to ""even the playing field"". At 2.15am on Sunday morning BGH signed confidentiality agreements with Virgin, giving the buyout firm access to its data room to inspect its books. BGH has $2.6 billion in it coffers and is working with heavy-hitting Melbourne lawyer Leon Zwier and outgoing PwC boss Luke Sayers. It is also backed by the nation's largest super fund, AustralianSuper, which manages $180 billion in retirement savings and is linked to the trade union movement. Former ACTU director Dave Oliver is a director. The BGH consortium is one of 11 groups Virgin's administrators say are interested in buying and relaunching the airline. Deloitte partner and Virgin administrator Vaughan Strawbridge hopes to find a new owner within three months. Buyout firms Bain Capital, Apollo and Oaktree are also said to be interested. So is US airline investor Indigo Partners, which owns a number of budget airlines across the Americas and Europe, including Frontier Airlines and Wizz Air, and which Virgin has approached in the past about becoming an investor, according to a source with knowledge of those conversations. State governments could also play a role in determining Virgin's future, with Queensland putting $200 million on the table and declaring it will ""stop at nothing"" to keep the airline in Brisbane, and NSW and Victoria expressing an interest in luring it south. Linsday Fox, who is close to Sayers, discussed a plan to bring Virgin to his privately-owned Avalon airport with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. Virgin first opened its data room three weeks ago so its major shareholders could consider recapitalising the business. The only one who came close was co-founder and 10 per cent shareholder Richard Branson. Observers note he had the most to lose from Virgin's collapse: the licence fees he gets for the Virgin brand, suggested to be worth around $15 million to $25 million a year. At a board meeting on Monday, Virgin's directors made the unenviable decision to appoint Deloitte as administrators. That firm was chosen a little over two weeks earlier at another meeting where there was mild disagreement about which group was best to advise the ailing airline. Sources aware of the selection process said the board of Virgin favoured KordaMentha, given its success with administrations with large unionised workforces, while Scurrah favoured  PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Unable to make a decision, they threw to CFO Keith Neate, who went for  Deloitte. Many in the Virgin camp are riled by the Morrison government's mantra that it did not want to bail out Virgin's foreign shareholders. They say every deal they put forward involved these shareholders being wiped out by an injection of new equity. Their backs are also up over how much money the government has given to Regional Express Airlines, believing the mostly foreign-owned company chaired by former Nationals leader John Sharp has received the lion's share of almost $300 million in assistance to the regional aviation industry. “If Virgin had been given that and a government guarantee, it may well have been able to do a solvent restructuring,” said one figure close to the events. Transport Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack's assistance package of $715 million in waived fees and levies for Virgin and Qantas appears to have made little impact at a time when they are barely flying. Virgin sources said it received the first $4 million cash injection from the program on Friday. At the same time, some investment banking sources (who declined to be named to maintain business relationships) were surprised that Virgin appeared to only be considering a rescue deal that included the government or administration and did not consider a debt-for-equity swap to rescue the company outside of administration, a mechanism used by Nine Entertainment and Slater & Gordon in the past. ""I couldn't even get them to return my call,"" said one senior investment banker. Many industry watchers now see administration as a chance for the loss-making Virgin to improve its business by ripping up bad contracts and shaking off unsustainable debts. But forces at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Morrison government could play a key role in determining whether that happens. Federal Labor and unions wanted the government to bail Virgin out to protect jobs and save the nation from a potential Qantas monopoly. Governments in America and across Europe have already extended billions of dollars in financial aid to their airlines as the pandemic forced them to ground operations. The Australian Council of Trade Unions will arrange representation for Virgin's 10,000 workers, who are owed $450 million in wages, leave and other entitlements. This could make them a decisive voting bloc when it comes to any rescue deal. ACTU president Michele O'Neil said the peak union body would support deals that were in the best interests of workers - which meant saving as many jobs as possible in a relaunched airline. The unions would support ""a buyer that has a viable plan for the long-term future for Virgin airlines, not a short term take-the-money-and-run proposal,"" she said. Meanwhile the holders of Virgin's $1.8 billion of junk bonds are concerned they will be asked to take a much larger haircut on what they are owed than Virgin's secured creditors - banks and aircraft lessors - and say they are ""up for a fight"". “This is not going to be as simple as everyone’s saying, and done and dusted in two or three weeks,"" said one investment banker.

11,/business/companies/the-week-that-virgin-australia-hit-the-ground-hard-20200423-p54mhp.html,The week that Virgin Australia hit the ground hard,"It was getting close to 8pm on Thursday night when Paul Scurrah finally accepted the airline he leads was unlikely to avoid financial collapse.  The Virgin Australia chief executive was attending a virtual meeting inside the makeshift office in his Brisbane home when bad news filtered through from Canberra. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had used a television interview to declare a fix to the airline's woes was at hand. It was not the type of solution Scurrah had been holding out for. Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah after announcing the company had gone into administration on Tuesday.Credit:Louise Kennerley Morrison said his government would not get in the way of a ""commercial solution"" to save Australia's second airline as it teetered on the brink of collapse. ""And there are many things going on there,” the Prime Minister said. It was the first time the Virgin camp had heard of a fix that did not involve at least some taxpayers' cash. The interview was a clear message that after weeks of back and forth, any hope of government support was shot. Australia's second airline went into voluntary administration on Monday, a move that adds to the uncertainty for its 10,000 employees, many of whom have been stood down during the coronavirus pandemic, and could change the face of aviation in this country.  The government's decision to let Virgin slide into administration has set off a multibillion-dollar race for control of the airline involving some of the nation's most powerful dealmakers and deepest-pocketed investors. It has already pitted state governments against each other. BGH Capital, the private equity firm led by well-connected dealmakers Ben Gray and Robin Bishop is the highest-profile investment firm in the race.  Transport billionaire and airport owner Linsday Fox is also eyeing the airline, along with various international investors. Yet while many potential buyers are circling Virgin, the government's decision is not without political risk. Administration, a mechanism designed to allow a company to survive while also clawing back money for lenders, can be messy, as other high-profile corporate implosions such as Network Ten show. The appointment of former Macquarie chief Nicholas Moore as an emissary for Morrison in the proceedings suggests the government is well aware of this and that it may end up being the buyer of last resort anyway. Morrison had repeatedly signalled in recent weeks that there would be no Virgin bailout. The government did not want to set a precedent that would prompt other challenged companies to seek assistance. Nor did it like the politics of being seen to support Virgin's foreign shareholders, which include aviation giants Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. But the Prime Minister's announcement on Thursday still came as a shock to those at Virgin who had been hanging on to hopes of support. A clip of the comment was quickly sent around to Scurrah and other senior managers, sparking a flurry of messages and phone calls. Replay   Virgin's management, board and bankers been working feverishly to restructure the group, weighed down with $6.8 billion in debt, so it could survive the coronavirus pandemic. Sources close to the survival project run by investment banks Houlihan Lokey and UBS and reporting to chairman Elizabeth Bryan say Virgin had attracted nine different parties who were looking at deals to keep the airline alive. However all of the proposals hinged on some level of government support. Scurrah, in the job for only 13 months, first wrote to Morrison on March 26 asking him for ""urgent support"" in the form of a $1.4 billion loan facility. Knocked back, the long-time transport and logistics executive returned with eight further proposals, the final one being for just $200 million he was convinced would buy Virgin enough time to finalise a solvent restructuring deal. Some observers believe Team Virgin should have realised its proposals were going nowhere. ""If you tell even a small child they can't have any chocolate seven times you have to question their intelligence when they come back again,"" said one senior banker. Still, despite the government signalling early on it would not provide financial support to specific companies, the Virgin camp believed there were encouraging signs and held out hope. But the switch in rhetoric from considering ""all options"" to ensure Australia retained two airlines (albeit with an assurance taxpayers would not ""bail out"" Virgin's foreign owners), to there being a ""commercial solution"" signalled that was over. Sources who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters said that in later talks, Morrison's office encouraged Virgin to talk to BGH. There is also a view within the Virgin camp that BGH's interest gave the government confidence it did not need to come to its assistance. “BGH came to Virgin through the government,” said one source with knowledge of the events. ""They’re very close to the government and were very clear and aggressive and saying: 'you don’t need to do anything, we’ll pick it up'."" The firm had sniffed around Virgin weeks earlier and had spoken to key figures at the airline including Scurrah and Bryan. But the two camps were at loggerheads about how the deal would be structured financially. One critic of Virgin, speaking on condition of anonymity, says the airline should have engaged more enthusiastically with BGH and other private suitors earlier.

12,/business/companies/csl-s-blood-payments-in-us-under-the-microscope-20200423-p54mnu.html,CSL's blood payments in US under the microscope,"CSL has been forced to defend the way it runs its blood plasma collection business in the US amid concerns the company will face increased scrutiny over how it handles the health and welfare of blood donors. Wealth manager Australian Ethical, which has $3.8 billion under management, is seeking clarity from the ASX- listed biotech giant on how it will manage the level and frequency of donation payments, at a time when unemployment is ramping up in the US. Plasma collection is a ""moral maze"" and the ethics are about to be front and centre, warn Credit Suisse analysts. Credit:Penny Stephens The head of ethics at Australian Ethical, Stuart Palmer, said while paying for plasma wasn't in itself unethical, there were concerns that some people may suffer harm from making frequent donations in order to earn money. ""The key concern is that some vulnerable people can suffer harm from giving plasma. This is particularly relevant in a time of increasing unemployment and under-employment where people are looking for supplementary income."" The US supplies the majority of the world's plasma and donors are paid for their blood, with payments usually starting at around $US50 ($90) per collection. The majority of plasma sourced by CSL comes from the US. The concerns raised by Australian Ethical come in the wake of a research note from Credit Suisse last week that warned CSL would have to closely manage the health and welfare of donors, suggesting the collections sector was in for increased scrutiny over how it treats donors. ""The principal risk is reputational. That is to say that CSL [would be] potentially mired in accusations of exploitation,"" the note said. It also warned that the sector's reliance on donors from low-socioeconomic backgrounds was attracting attention and that CSL's planned new donation centres ""have an even higher propensity than the industry average to be located in regions where the local population are more economically vulnerable to exploitation."" CSL chief medical officer Dr Charmaine Gittleson said there were no ethical or health concerns associated with blood plasma donation, saying it was in CSL's best interests to ensure the ongoing health of donors and there were no large long-term studies linking health risks to frequent donations. ""We have 48 million donations happening each year and every plasma centre is monitoring them for safety. All of that information gets collected and put into formal systems. Regulators are able to look at data across the years and are able to track the safety of donations,"" she said. ""And we have not seen any significant regulatory changes to how [plasma] is collected."" Australian Ethical's Palmer said the Credit Suisse report had raised pertinent issues for CSL to address. ""The research does raise important industry concerns about the frequency of permitted donations, how much donors are paid and companies’ responsibility for understanding health impacts on regular donors and having appropriate processes in place to prevent risky donations."" ""Payment levels should take account of the value and profitability of the plasma products being created. These are issues we intend to discuss further with CSL."" Valued at $139 billion, CSL is one of the most valuable companies on the ASX, largely because of growth in its blood plasma therapy business. It collects plasma, the yellow liquid in blood which carries cells and proteins, and turns it into life saving therapies. CSL has been updating investors on the rollout of new centres over the past year to cater for global growing demand for plasma products. One industry expert said those sites were likely chosen where zoning regulations were favourable and there was good access to public transport. In response to concerns raised in the Credit Suisse report, CSL said plasma donors understood and appreciated their role in delivering life-altering therapies and that ethics and regulatory safety were the company's number one focus. CSL is a member of industry groups including the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association, which is currently undertaking a longitudinal study of donor health. ""The consequence of incomplete or inaccurate reporting on this subject can risk the health of many around the world who live with rare, serious and life-threatening conditions."" The Credit Suisse report also raised the spectre of new regulations around how migrant donors contribute plasma, which could limit or make it more expensive for donors to cross the border from Mexico to come to centres operated by CSL's. Credit Suisse believes the company has a 5 per cent exposure to Mexican donors. CSL chief executive Paul Perreault. Credit:Eamon Gallagher One industry expert said CSL would be in the box seat if the sector faced tighter regulation, because its governance practices were already best in class. Unlike other players in the US market, CSL has more consistent internal systems for collection and donor monitoring and would be ready to move faster than competitors to roll out new requirements, they said. Australian equities analysts have questioned whether the company can collect enough plasma in the coming months to offset slowdowns caused by coronavirus shutdowns. Citi and JP Morgan have both said that because there is a delay between the collection and sale of plasma products, the true impact of pandemic shutdowns on CSL are not yet known. On an investor call to discuss COVID-19 earlier this month, management were asked how they were encouraging donations and whether they anticipated the price they pay to donors would go up or down given rising unemployment. CSL chief executive Paul Perreault said the company was ""pulling all levers"" to encourage donations, though it was impossible to predict whether the amount on offer to donors would change. ""I don't know, I can't tell you. It all depends on what happens,"" he said. Emma is the small business reporter for The Age and Sydney Morning Herald based in Melbourne.

Like other countries battling to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, Australia is facing a sharp rise in unemployment. The spotlight will be on the health of the office market post the coronavirusCredit:Peter Braig Morgan Stanley economists expect unemployment to increase to 9 per cent in 2020, settling around 7.9 per cent by the end of the year. Other estimates say it could rise higher. The mass layoff of workers will cause a substantial reduction in demand for office space in the short term and reduced expectations over the medium term. That is likely to push vacancy above 10 per cent in Sydney and Melbourne, according to UBS analyst Grant McCasker. ""This will see a substantial increase in incentives, of about a 50 per cent increase in Sydney and Melbourne and reduction in face rents of 10 per cent over the next 12-18 months,"" he said in a note to clients. The job cuts will also result in net effective rents for prime offices falling up to 20 per cent over the next 12 months, UBS estimates. Savills Australia’s Melbourne leasing head Mark Rasmussen said tenant inquiry has slowed substantially across the city centre as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, but there was an upside – a significant rise in inquiry from both state and federal governments. “Most private businesses are avoiding any decisions if they can,” he said. The lockdown and shift to home working is fundamentally reshaping how businesses view their use of space. Smaller businesses, that had previously refused to let staff work from home, were now actively considering downsizing their office requirements. “There is certainly going to be more people looking at the option of working from home,” he said. But Mr Rasmussen says while vacancy will rise, ""it’s not going to be a bloodbath.” Most large city corporates, particularly banks and global consulting firms, were already well down the journey of introducing flexible works systems, a fact that would dilute the impact of any coronavirus-inspired change. “In prime grade buildings vacancy will stay fairly low but we will see a substantial increase in incentives,” he predicted. Melbourne’s prime grade vacancy is expected to rise to around 5 per cent by mid-2021, but now it may top 6 per cent. Overall, landlords will be very reluctant to drop rents, he said. Morgan Stanley's analysts are more bearish. The bank predicts Sydney’s office vacancy will rise above 10 per cent as unemployment escalates. ""What's more concerning is that there is almost a 0.7 per cent correlation between NSW job ads and Sydney CBD office net absorption based on data since 2007,"" the bank said. Despite the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, big tenants are hunting for new digs with some seeing an opportunity to get more space at a better rent. Collectively Westpac, Australia Post and the Commonwealth Bank are in the market for about 100,000 square metres in Sydney and Melbourne. Westpac began its search for 40,000 sq m late last year and will likely review those specifications once the full impact of the virus is known and it can assess how many staff wish to keep working from home. In Melbourne, the Commonwealth Bank is in the market for 18,000 sq m. It currently has staff located at 357 Collins Street and in Lang Walker’s Mercer building in the Docklands. Australia Post has a requirement for 40,000 sq m in Melbourne and is actively reconsidering its head lease at 111 Bourke Street, a building owned by Brookfield Asset Management.

However, shortly after, it moved to Mt Eliza to allow the students to have a healthier life by the sea. “We wanted to respond to these buildings, but obviously take STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) into a contemporary scheme,” says Deb Ryan, Principal of McBride Charles Ryan (MCR) Architecture + Interior Design. Hudson and Wardrop’s Arts & Crafts-style buildings have a strong English feel, with steep gabled roofs and tall chimneys. The main administration wing, with its stucco tower, is a reminder of the school’s past. MCR‘s scheme, the result of a limited competition, responded to both Hudson and Wardrop design, with its cloistered courtyard, as much as to Edna Walling’s gardens. MCR was also keen to empower young women through its architecture. “If you look at where many of the jobs will be in the future, it’s in the STEM fields,” says Ryan. As with many of the historic buildings on the senior school campus, each elevation has its own unique characteristics. Likewise, the new STEM wing, almost embracing the manicured sporting lawns, has four differently treated facades. The southern elevation, for example, comprises seven different coloured bricks, from beige through to grey and windows beautifully detailed with crevices to speak to a more ornate style from the past.

However, the STEM wing’s northern elevation, with its dramatic curved facade and rhythmic placement of windows that comes as a surprise. “The starting point was slicing into a cylindrical cone and tilting it on its side,” says Ryan. Entering STEM is akin to stepping into a brave new world. The main auditorium, for example, features a laser cut MDF ceiling with a floral motif and is lined with fabric for acoustic control. Here, again, the homage to Edna Walling is apparent. “Nature is an important part of the STEM program,” she adds. The main ‘streetscape’, with its west and east entrances, is also fresh and contemporary with sinuous snake-like seating in bright red upholstery snaking itself from one end to the other. Loosely arranged chairs and tables allow students to study informally or simply catch up. “We wanted the spaces to be engaging as well as comfortable and offering a level of flexibility,” says Ryan. The two ‘super labs’ adjacent to these breakout spaces, are also flanked by a variety of seating arrangements for students. “We also wanted to make the labs pleasurable to be in, rather than feeling clinical,’ says Ryan, a tour-de-force when it comes to colour having created a strong dose of blue walls in the mix. One of the most powerful spaces in the STEM design is the boardroom, a domain often given over to men. “We wanted to allow these young women to know how it felt to occupy a space that’s not always readily accessible,” says Ryan, pointing out the impressive distant views over Port Phillip Bay. Used by both staff and students, the boardroom was also delivered with great comfort, with chairs and furniture that could easily be found in a boardroom.

The plants, four of which are in western Victoria and the other near Broken, had been restricted since last September to supplying only half their full capacity of more then 350 megawatts because of congestion on the local grid. Gannawarra Solar Farm in western Victoria, was one of the plants to have its output cut in half in September 2019 by AEMO. A week of tests overseen by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and SMA Australia monitored the performance both individually and as a group of the five solar farms. Engineers used a technical fix to inverters at the plants to smooth power supplies. ""It went well - all generators are very pleased with the outcome,""  said Scott Partlin, an executive with SMA Australia. The company supplied inverters - which modulate voltage - to all five farms. Mr Partlin said collaboration was key to resolving the issue and could prove to be a useful template for fixing such matters if they arise again in the future. A spokeswoman for the Clean Energy Investor Group, which represents the five solar farms, welcomed the lifting of the so-called curtailment on the plants. Some media had put the revenue loss at as much as $1 million a day. ""Once the curtailed generator issues are resolved, we understand the commissioning and connection of other affected generators in the Western Murray Zone will commence,"" the spokeswoman said.

22,/business/markets/as-crude-prices-collapsed-the-oil-glut-produced-one-big-winner-20200424-p54mrp.html,"As crude prices collapsed, the oil glut produced one big winner","The price of oil has plunged, but the price of finding a place to put it has soared. So if you're in the shipping industry and in the business of providing a temporary home for the world's glut of crude, you've hit the jackpot. More and more massive tankers at sea are being used simply to hold the oil — as much as 2 million barrels per vessel — until it is wanted. Other vessels are busy carrying it to buyers like China, which is taking advantage of prices not seen in two decades. Tankers are in demand, and their rates, as low as $US25,000 ($31,315) a day in February, have ballooned to nearly $US200,000 a day. More and more massive tankers at sea are being used simply to hold the oil, at lucrative prices.Credit:Eric Gay ""We are one of the few industries making money in this period,"" said Hugo de Stoop, chief executive of Belgium-based Euronav, one of the world's largest tanker companies. The current market for vessels, he added, ""is totally and completely unusual."" Shipping is a business of wild swings that tax a vessel operator's patience and balance sheet, and right now tanker owners are profiting from the same forces that are causing layoffs and bankruptcies at oil companies elsewhere. Demand for oil has plummeted by about one-third as airplanes are parked on runways and cars sit at home, stilled by lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and its allies have ramped up output, as part of a price war with Russia. The flood is filling tank farms to the brim, so traders and producers are chartering ships like de Stoop's 70 oil tankers to hold their crude, waiting for a more advantageous moment to unload it. The tanker industry is having its best spell in at least a decade, analysts say. Ships owned by companies like Euronav are like taxis, waiting for fares. Most of Euronav's ships operate at so-called spot rates, essentially whatever they negotiate with customers, which vary from day to day. Oil companies have been chartering Euronav's Very Large Crude Carriers, or VLCCs — tankers longer than three football fields — for $US150,000 to $US200,000 a day, de Stoop said, depending on where they are going. As it costs about $US18,000 a day to run a ship — for expenses like paying and feeding a crew of 25 — profits at the moment are huge. It's not always this way. To give an idea of the ups and downs possible in the industry, a tanker now heading from the Middle East to China will earn on average about $US178,000 a day compared with $US15,000 a year ago, according to Clarksons, a ship brokerage. After Saudi Arabia and Russia kicked off their price war in early March, rates soared to well more than $US200,000 a day as the Saudis chartered as many as 18 tankers. The tanker business is receiving an added boost from the futures market, in which traders are betting that oil in the months ahead will sell for much higher prices than the depressed $US20 a barrel that Brent crude, the international benchmark, has fetched this week. Traders figure they can make money by parking oil on ships and selling it later. The volume of oil idling off places like Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates or near a Chevron refinery in Long Beach, California, has soared 40 per cent since the beginning of April, to 158 million barrels, said Alexander Booth, head of market analysis at Kpler, which tracks petroleum shipments. That is more oil than the world would consume over a day and a half in normal times. As shipowners relish the moment, some analysts warn that this corner of the oil industry is unlikely to thrive for long because of depressed demand for crude. Jonathan Chappell, a shipping analyst at Evercore ISI, a securities broker, said once normality returns the futures market will shift, and traders and companies will liquidate the inventories of oil built up at sea and on land, slashing the need for ships. ""At some point,"" he said, ""you are going to have to work through the hangover."" The New York Times Copyright © 2020", Stanley Reed ,"April 24, 2020"

While the money involved is small, it's revived a furor in Denmark over reports last year that Trump was musing about purchasing Greenland. The US is seeking to counter growing assertiveness in the Arctic by Russia and China. The $US12.1 million will go toward priorities including tapping Greenland's abundant mineral resources, promoting tourism and boosting ties with the island's people, a senior State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The US also plans to open a consulate in Nuuk, the capital, within several months. The idea of binding Greenland closer to the US has been a priority for the Trump administration for some time.Credit:iStockphoto Greenland's government said on Thursday that the aid package would ""benefit the economic development of Greenland, including the mineral industry, tourism and education."" ""It takes time to develop closer relationships with other countries,"" Greenland Premier Kim Kielsen said, according to a government statement. ""But this good news confirms that our work on building a constructive relationship with the United States is fruitful."" US Ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands wrote in an opinion column in Danish media outlet Altinget on Wednesday that it was meant in part to counter Russia's ""aggressive behaviour and increased militarisation in the Arctic"" and China's ""predatory economic interests"" in the region. But the funding angered some officials in Denmark. Karsten Honge, a member of the foreign affairs committee with the Socialist People's Party, said the move ""clearly crossed the line"" and was trying to sow divisions in Denmark. Trump cancelled a planned trip to Denmark last year after Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dismissed as absurd Trump's desire to buy Greenland, which was reported by the Wall Street Journal. Trump called the prime minister's remark ""nasty"" and ""inappropriate"". The senior administration official said there was no internal US process underway to buy Greenland. Nonetheless, binding Greenland closer to the US has been a priority for the Trump administration for some time. A person familiar with US plans, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations, said the idea was to rebuff Chinese and Russian influence and win over Greenland's residents, with the eventual goal of buying the island if possible.

24,/business/the-economy/australia-s-china-challenge-in-the-post-coronavirus-world-20200422-p54mbp.html,Australia's China challenge in the post-coronavirus world,"The coronavirus was a health story. It is now an economic story. Before we know it, it will become a geo-strategic story and Australia has a blind spot. There are two major challenges Australia must face as it navigates a post-coronavirus world which will be dominated by the US retreat from its sphere of influence and China’s increasingly muscular diplomacy. The first is our lack of direct access to China. There are few, if any, MPs in Parliament who have a relationship with their Chinese counterpart. How does Australia navigate the geo-strategic environment of the post-coronavirus world? Credit:Matt Davidson Australian MPs can count substantial networks in Washington, London and Jakarta, but none with the National People’s Congress of our largest trading partner. Half-a-dozen offices in Parliament have a sticker of wolf claw marks on their front window. They belong to the Parliamentary Friends of Democracy - an informal group made up of Liberal senators James Paterson and Amanda Stoker, Labor’s Kimberley Kitching and the chair and deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Andrew Hastie and Anthony Byrne. The stickers are a statement. A direct response to the Chinese Communist Party's increasingly assertive “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” that has seen it attempt to buy political capital in Australia, take aggressive steps in the Pacific, exchange barbs with the United States and wield influence over the World Health Organisation. These are legitimate concerns about a country accused of judicial and human rights violations from the Muslim ""re-education"" camps in Xinjiang to Hong Kong democracy protesters. So too are the allegations of negligence and cover-up in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, which this week filtered down to the local council level when Wagga Wagga, NSW, threatened to sever its twin city relationship Kunming, China. The stasis now goes right to the top. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is one of the few G20 leaders not to have direct contact with China’s President Xi Jinping since the coronavirus outbreak. In this context, it is worth considering if Australia is getting the best seat it can at a rapidly changing diplomatic table.  When former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd walked out the door, who replaced him? According to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, China accounts for $136 billion in Australian trade. It is our number one export market, our largest source of international students, our most valuable tourism market, a major source of foreign direct investment and our largest agricultural goods market. At the moment, we can not get on the phone. Inherent in all of this is the great tension between Australia’s foreign affairs and trade arms. One prioritises security, the other economics, within the one government department. “China might have got us into this crisis but it is also the country most likely to lead us out of it,” Jane Golley, the director of the Australian National University’s China and the World Centre told the Centre for Economic Development this week. “There is a real need to strike a better balance than we have in the past.” KPMG's head of Asia and international markets Doug Ferguson said Australia wants to find growth areas in other markets. ""It is just not easy to do. India, Europe, frankly do not offer the same scale and acceleration as China."" If our strategy is walking into a room holding our nose saying we don’t like you but we want to do business with you. Inevitably that business is going to go. Labor has called for a bipartisan China committee that would mark objectives and make policy. Spanning elections and governments it would define what Australia wants out of its relationship with China over 15 years. It would deliver a plan to deal with a country that by 2035 will likely become the world’s largest economy. That time-frame also once defined Australia’s second major international challenge, the place of China in the Pacific and what was once Australia’s sphere of influence. The coronavirus has just accelerated it. Replay   Our $50 billion submarine program, the only naval platform that will truly allow Australia to patrol its own trading routes in foreign waters - and therefore shore up Australia’s economic interests - is now seriously exposed. Once scheduled for the mid 2020s, the first one is not due until 2035 as Australia’s neighbours face an increasingly assertive China as it begins its own staggered economic recovery from the coronavirus. To Australia’s north Indonesia and Papua New Guinea face potentially catastrophic coronavirus outcomes. There are early signs it is taking hold in both countries. Indonesia now has 590 virus deaths, the most outside China, while PNG has cases in four different provinces. A virus outbreak on the scale seen in China would devastate the less advanced medical systems and economies of both countries. The Pacific, which has developed at a slower rate than anywhere else in the world for the past decade, is similarly exposed. In this space, Australia is in a relatively unique position. The country is on track to become the first middle-power and along with New Zealand, the only developed economy in the eastern time zone of the Southern Hemisphere to suppress the virus. In a series of deliberately timed escalations this week, Australia started flexing its new-found diplomatic strength. Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for an independent global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus on Sunday, a move that was backed by Morrison in discussions with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Beijing accused Canberra of political maneuvering and ideological bias. “It will disrupt international cooperation in fighting the pandemic and goes against people's shared aspiration,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday night. No doubt it was political. Expect Australia to go further. With the exception of East Timor, Australia has played a largely reactive role in the region, comforted by US hegemony, bobbing like a cork in an ocean of strategic interests. That is now under threat as the coronavirus infects more than 800,000 Americans, while a President already prone to isolationism, turns increasingly inwards to confront a profound domestic health crisis and a personal challenge - his own re-election in November. Does a resilient Australia step into the void? The government’s Pacific step-up is crucial in this environment. It is well capitalised with a $2 billion infrastructure financing initiative but it can not compete with the trillions being spent on Beijing’s Belt and Road. Australia’s government departments and universities are among the top Pacific experts in the world and our soft-diplomacy through cultural connections and rugby league is well regarded, but until China started loaning millions of dollars for local infrastructure in Vanuatu and PNG, the political relationship was largely taken for granted. It was a jolt Australia needed. Can we play big and become a true diplomatic leader for the region? An Australia that is taken seriously in Beijing and Washington gives us the flexibility to be friends when we want to be friends, to contest if you want to contest.

25,/business/the-economy/australia-s-china-challenge-in-the-post-coronavirus-world-20200422-p54mbp.html,Australia's China challenge in the post-coronavirus world,"The coronavirus was a health story. It is now an economic story. Before we know it, it will become a geo-strategic story and Australia has a blind spot. There are two major challenges Australia must face as it navigates a post-coronavirus world which will be dominated by the US retreat from its sphere of influence and China’s increasingly muscular diplomacy. The first is our lack of direct access to China. There are few, if any, MPs in Parliament who have a relationship with their Chinese counterpart. How does Australia navigate the geo-strategic environment of the post-coronavirus world? Credit:Matt Davidson Australian MPs can count substantial networks in Washington, London and Jakarta, but none with the National People’s Congress of our largest trading partner. Half-a-dozen offices in Parliament have a sticker of wolf claw marks on their front window. They belong to the Parliamentary Friends of Democracy - an informal group made up of Liberal senators James Paterson and Amanda Stoker, Labor’s Kimberley Kitching and the chair and deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Andrew Hastie and Anthony Byrne. The stickers are a statement. A direct response to the Chinese Communist Party's increasingly assertive “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” that has seen it attempt to buy political capital in Australia, take aggressive steps in the Pacific, exchange barbs with the United States and wield influence over the World Health Organisation. These are legitimate concerns about a country accused of judicial and human rights violations from the Muslim ""re-education"" camps in Xinjiang to Hong Kong democracy protesters. So too are the allegations of negligence and cover-up in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, which this week filtered down to the local council level when Wagga Wagga, NSW, threatened to sever its twin city relationship Kunming, China. The stasis now goes right to the top. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is one of the few G20 leaders not to have direct contact with China’s President Xi Jinping since the coronavirus outbreak. In this context, it is worth considering if Australia is getting the best seat it can at a rapidly changing diplomatic table.  When former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd walked out the door, who replaced him? According to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, China accounts for $136 billion in Australian trade. It is our number one export market, our largest source of international students, our most valuable tourism market, a major source of foreign direct investment and our largest agricultural goods market. At the moment, we can not get on the phone. Inherent in all of this is the great tension between Australia’s foreign affairs and trade arms. One prioritises security, the other economics, within the one government department. “China might have got us into this crisis but it is also the country most likely to lead us out of it,” Jane Golley, the director of the Australian National University’s China and the World Centre told the Centre for Economic Development this week. “There is a real need to strike a better balance than we have in the past.” KPMG's head of Asia and international markets Doug Ferguson said Australia wants to find growth areas in other markets. ""It is just not easy to do. India, Europe, frankly do not offer the same scale and acceleration as China."" If our strategy is walking into a room holding our nose saying we don’t like you but we want to do business with you. Inevitably that business is going to go. Labor has called for a bipartisan China committee that would mark objectives and make policy. Spanning elections and governments it would define what Australia wants out of its relationship with China over 15 years. It would deliver a plan to deal with a country that by 2035 will likely become the world’s largest economy. That time-frame also once defined Australia’s second major international challenge, the place of China in the Pacific and what was once Australia’s sphere of influence. The coronavirus has just accelerated it. Replay   Our $50 billion submarine program, the only naval platform that will truly allow Australia to patrol its own trading routes in foreign waters - and therefore shore up Australia’s economic interests - is now seriously exposed. Once scheduled for the mid 2020s, the first one is not due until 2035 as Australia’s neighbours face an increasingly assertive China as it begins its own staggered economic recovery from the coronavirus. To Australia’s north Indonesia and Papua New Guinea face potentially catastrophic coronavirus outcomes. There are early signs it is taking hold in both countries. Indonesia now has 590 virus deaths, the most outside China, while PNG has cases in four different provinces. A virus outbreak on the scale seen in China would devastate the less advanced medical systems and economies of both countries. The Pacific, which has developed at a slower rate than anywhere else in the world for the past decade, is similarly exposed. In this space, Australia is in a relatively unique position. The country is on track to become the first middle-power and along with New Zealand, the only developed economy in the eastern time zone of the Southern Hemisphere to suppress the virus. In a series of deliberately timed escalations this week, Australia started flexing its new-found diplomatic strength. Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for an independent global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus on Sunday, a move that was backed by Morrison in discussions with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.

26,/business/the-economy/our-roadmap-out-of-this-economic-crisis-was-delivered-12-years-ago-20200422-p54m2y.html,Our roadmap out of this economic crisis was delivered 12 years ago,"Exactly 12 years ago this month, prime minister Kevin Rudd hosted a ""2020 summit"" at Parliament House in Canberra, gathering the nation's ""best and brightest"" minds to brainstorm the reforms needed to build a strong and resilient nation. Not one person in that room could possibly have anticipated just how strong or how resilient Australians would need to be when 2020 finally rolled around. But the major proposal to arise from that summit – the need for a new roadmap on tax reform – remains as relevant today as ever. Illustration: Dionne GainCredit:  The task of writing the roadmap was handed to former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, who delivered his final report in 2010, only to watch, ashen-faced, as Rudd ruled out in a press conference all but a handful of Henry's 138 recommendations. But as policymakers look to build the pathway out of the current COVID-19 crisis, Henry’s roadmap has been plucked out of the dustbin of history by Reserve Bank governor Phil Lowe. Speaking on Tuesday, Lowe urged our political leaders to ""reignite"" the nation’s growth and productivity agenda, by reconsidering, among other things, the way we tax ""income generation, consumption and land"". Which is exactly what Henry did, a decade ago. Henry’s recommendations are so enduring because they mapped out the most fundamental principles of tax reform. Perhaps chief among them was the simple observation that humans respond to the incentives they face. Change those incentives, and you change behaviour. And all taxes, by altering incentives, change behaviour. Impose a tax on labour income, for example, and you reduce the returns from working. Sit back and watch as people decide to work less. Reduce the after-tax return from making a profit, and watch as some businesses chose to invest less, or to relocate elsewhere where potential after-tax returns are higher. It's a key insight of economics that all taxes destroy economic activity, because they stop transactions from occurring that would otherwise have occurred. Economists label this destruction of value the ""dead weight loss"" of taxation. Another insight, however, of both economics and Henry's review is that different types of human endeavour are more or less responsive to the imposition of taxes. Tax a loaf of bread and you still need to eat bread. Tax land owners and it’s very difficult – impossible, actually – for them to move offshore. Ken Henry with Kevin Rudd at a meeting of the Strategic Priority and Budget Committee in Parliament House during the GFC in 2008. Credit:Glen McCurtayne One crucial graph in Henry’s review provided the real punchline, ranking different taxes according to the losses they impose on society. State-levied stamp duties sat clearly at the top – discouraging property transactions and a more efficient use of housing. Taxes on company profits and labour income sat in the middle. Land tax sat at the very bottom, being the most efficient form of taxation, and taxes on ""consumption"" sat just above that (consumption being code for the goods and services tax, which Henry was forbidden from considering, but did anyway). In reality, it’s hard to quantify the exact size of losses created by taxation. But the direction is clear: it’s negative. The act of taxation cannot add to growth. What you do with the money raised, of course, may well add to growth, if invested towards enhancing the human capital of your people, for example, or otherwise expanding the productive capacity of your economy. But such investments always come with an upfront cost – the losses created by taxation. The goal of good tax design, then, is to minimise that upfront cost. Make taxes simple. Make them transparent. Make them hard to avoid. To the extent that some efficient taxes may be unfair – such as the GST, which does not discriminate between a rich person buying bread and a poor person – you should address this unfairness with your transfer system. Don’t rely excessively on growth-destroying taxes just to achieve your goal of fairness. If a pensioner can’t afford groceries because of a higher GST, increase their pension. Deliver efficiency with your tax system and fairness with your transfer system. We’ve just experienced a watershed moment in this nation’s policy-making history. Things that were unimaginable mere weeks ago have come to pass. The very basis of our social contract has been torn up and rewritten – for the better. Now is no time to stop. The urgency to design a tax system to help us grow out of this crisis is of no less importance than the policies just unleashed to help us survive it. Tax reform is not about needing to raise more revenue to repay government debt faster. Interest rates are low. Debt will take care of itself if we can grow our economy fast enough. Tax reform is about how to raise the revenue we do need in the least distorting way. Reforms that shift the burden of tax away from highly mobile factors of production, such as labour and income, and towards more immoveable things, such as land and consumption, must, as Lowe says, form a key part of policy efforts to bring us out of this crisis. Our political leaders have shown bravery in their embrace of bold actions on the spending side of the budget. Similar levels of bravery will be required to design the tax system we need to promote economic growth on the other side of this health crisis. Luckily, the roadmap we need has been sitting there all along.

27,/business/the-economy/australians-forked-out-an-extra-2-7b-stocking-their-pantries-in-march-20200422-p54m75.html,Australians spent extra $2.7 billion stocking pantries in March,"Hoarders of toilet paper and canned goods have delivered the biggest one-month surge in retail sales on record, but it won't be enough to stop the economy from contracting. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released partial data on Wednesday showing retail sales had soared by 8.2 per cent in March. Replay   Supermarkets and grocery stores drove the lift along with alcohol and other specialised foods. Food sales were up 23.5 per cent or more than $2.7 billion. Toilet and tissue paper sales more than doubled, as did flour, rice and pasta. There was a 50 per cent jump in canned foods, cleaning goods and medicinal products. The bureau noted there was a peak in mid-March before sales levelled off towards the end of the month as people ran out of space to store their goods. Other areas to benefit were the electrical and hardware sectors, as people rushed to set up home offices. The March surge was the largest monthly jump in spending on record, eclipsing the previous record of 8.1 per cent set in June 2000 ahead of the introduction of the GST. That was followed by the worst monthly result on record: a 10.6 per cent drop in spending in July of that year. But parts of the retail sector took a hammering through the month as the coronavirus crisis deepened. Turnover through cafes, restaurants and takeaways tumbled by 20 per cent. Clothing sales fell by a similar amount. Department store sales dropped by 10 per cent as shoppers spent their time either at home or in supermarket aisles. The figures followed data from the Housing Industry Association that showed new home sales down 23.2 per cent in March. There were big falls across all states, with sales down by 31.6 per cent in Western Australia. The ""best"" result was in Victoria where sales dropped by 16.9 per cent. In a sign that retail conditions had been improving before the coronavirus pandemic, sales through the March quarter were down by 0.9 per compared to the same period last year. AMP senior economist Diana Mousina said panic buying of food and alcohol had supported the overall retail sector through the month. But that would end as people ate through their supplies of canned tomatoes while social distancing rules prevented consumers from heading out to cafes. ""In contrast, March US retail sales were down more than 8 per cent – clearly Australians were panic buying more than the Americans,"" she said. Ms Mousina said overall retail spending was likely to boost March quarter GDP by 0.4 percentage points, but that would not be enough to save broader consumer spending. ""Motor vehicle sales are down nearly 18 per cent over the year to March and will drag on spending,"" she said. ""As well, the increased demand for grocery items will lead to a big run-down in inventories which detracts from GDP growth. We still expect March-quarter GDP to be negative.""

Three proxy advisers, CGI Glass Lewis, Ownership Matters and ISS, have lined up to recommend shareholders reject the report, describing the remuneration package as “excessive”, “far too generous” and “allows executives to receive significant wealth if AMP substantially underperforms peers”. It is a damning assessment that suggests the company took a ham-fisted approach to selling the package to investors and the trifecta of proxy advisers. To stop the strike it will need to do some swift talking ahead of the AGM. AMP CEO Francesco De FerrariCredit:Janie Barrett For now it is resolute that the size and hurdles attached to the remuneration package are reasonable given the challenges facing chief executive Francesco De Ferrari and his senior executive team as they embark on a three-year transformation strategy. AMP has a big retail investor base and so some direction on its dividend, particularly given the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA) recent directive to the banks about dividends, will help. In a statement, an AMP spokesman said: “In developing the 2019 remuneration framework, performance hurdles and conditions attached, the board considered the exceptional circumstances facing the business. The remuneration structure has been designed to reflect the scale, complexity and challenge in AMP’s transformation.” But the jury is out on the transformation strategy. And while everyone agrees De Ferrari has a big job in front of him, he is being paid well. His total fixed pay of $3.9 million is more than double the median for an ASX 20-50 CEO of $1.76 million and the total remuneration package of $13.4 million is almost three times the ASX 20-50 median of $5 million, according to CGI Glass’s report. At issue is the awards are structured in such a way that the long-term incentive award is set at between 4.5 times and 5 times fixed pay for most senior executives. Another concern is the performance hurdles are weak. We also find the double long-term incentive granted to the CEO [Francesco De Ferrari] to be excessive.” To put it into perspective, the hurdles are such that half the awards will vest even if AMP underperforms by 10 per cent its peer index and 75 per cent will vest if its performance is in line with that of a peer ASX100 financial services index. As CGI Glass said in its report: “That the awards vest for total shareholder returns performance below the benchmark index total shareholder return (TSR) performance compounds our concerns as to these awards. We also find the double long-term incentive granted to the CEO [Francesco De Ferrari] to be excessive in a year when he has been provided with so much value as a result of amending his sign-on awards.” Ownership Matters says the value of the allocation to six AMP executives excluding the acting CFO was $28.6 million and was almost $65 million across all participants. “Shareholders should also note that as AMP no longer seeks shareholder approval for its CEO’s equity incentives the only way to register opposition to the structure of the transformation incentive is to vote against the remuneration report,” Ownership Matters says. Such profound concerns about the amount and structure of the remuneration package relating to transformation incentives isn’t a good look for a company that has performed so poorly for its shareholders in recent years. In the past five years AMP’s share price has fallen from $6 a share to close at $1.30 on Friday. Nor is it morale building for the rest of the company including some of its advisers who have been reeling over changes in  Buyer of Last Resort (BOLR) arrangements, set out as part of its transformation strategy. De Ferrari joined AMP as fresh blood in January 2019 to try and repair its battered reputation after some shocking revelations during the 2018 royal commission, including charging its clients fees-for-no-service and lying to the regulator on multiple occasions. The scandal resulted in a series of class actions, huge profit falls and massive fund outflows. During the royal commission, billions of dollars was transferred from AMP’s super funds to industry funds. But De Ferrari's strategy is far from foolproof. Indeed one of its key divisions, the Australian Wealth Management division, has been on a downward trend for more than six years. The only source of net inflows is its North product, which is the company’s lowest margin product. All its other products, which charge higher fees, had outflows. This was a problem for AMP long before the global pandemic. Its latest results released on Thursday are a continuation of that trend, with the company recording a $1.9 billion net cash outflow in the March 2020 quarter. To fix the problem will require a sizeable reduction in fees in the other products, which would require a significant growth to offset the decline. De Ferrari also needs to complete the sale of AMP Life business to Resolution Life for $3 billion. The market was told a month ago that it was confident the sale would proceed at a target date of June 30. It hasn’t backed away from this. Despite this, some investors said they were concerned it could be delayed and that would result in capital issues and a possible further renegotiated sale price. AMP is also exposed to the risk of a further blowout in its customer remediation provisions which stood at $652 million at the end of 2019, given the banks have continually ratcheted up the size of their provisions for customer remediation. In the past year banks have put aside an estimated $6 billion in remediation costs. Given it has one of the biggest army of advisers, it wouldn't be a stretch to see it lift its provisions to between $2 billion and $3 billion. For now, it isn’t budging on its provisions. With so many challenges, the board and its investor relations team will have their work cut out trying to convince shareholders not to vote against its remuneration package.

The big four banks have made a raft of changes, including loan deferrals and rate cuts, to help customers thrown into financial stress by the coronavirus shutdown. Commonwealth Bank refunded late fees and interest to credit card holders who failed to pay minimum repayments in March and has pledged to assess customer claims for further relief on a case-by-case basis. NAB also waived late payment fees and reduced minimum monthly payments on all credit cards for three months. These changes were applied automatically to new and existing customers starting in April. The relief measures come as APRA chairman Wayne Byres told boards to consider dividend deferrals, prompting analysts to forecast dividend suspensions from ANZ Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac.

The wealth giant revealed $10.7 billion had been wiped over the past quarter from funds managed by global investment arm AMP Capital, in a market update on Thursday. Chief executive Francesco De Ferrari said there were significant falls in equities, fixed income and key commodities prices in March. The group reported $308.7 billion in total assets under management across both AMP Capital and its wealth management arm. AMP chief executive Francesco De Ferrari says demand for financial advice has never been higher. Credit: Peter Braig ""We have seen some recovery since the quarter-end, but expect market volatility to continue and the economic impact of the pandemic to emerge over the remainder of the year,"" Mr De Ferrari said. AMP Capital was looking for opportunities amid the downturn, Mr De Ferrari said, including infrastructure investment and debt. Losses in the capital arm were slightly offset by gains in their Australian dollar value, as a higher portion of these assets were exposed to foreign currency ""which benefited from the depreciation"", the company said. Tribeca Investment's lead portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu said it ""looks pretty bad"" for AMP but added problems with cashflow were to be expected. ""We have all heard how tough it’s been,"" she said. Ms Liu said AMP's capital buffer was reliant on the sale of its life insurance business and that a capital raise could be on the cards if the deal with London-based Resolution Life was not passed. ""It is interesting they didn't really say much about the sale of the life business, which is the biggest issue for AMP. They're waiting on this sale to be approved and need that funding."" AMP Wealth also took a beating, with total funds under management shrinking by $18.2 billion in the quarter. The company said this was partly due to weaker investment markets and that the government's Protecting Your Super legislation, which caps some fees and forces money in inactive superannuation accounts to be sent to the Australian Tax Office, also contributed to outflows of $205 million. The federal government's early access to superannuation scheme officially opened on Monday, with over 450,000 Australians applying to access up to $10,000 from their retirement savings. AMP said it expected 1 per cent of its super members to withdraw cash under the scheme and therefore did not forecast further outflows from this arm of the business. In banking, AMP's loan book grew by $162 million, mostly in residential mortgages, and total deposits increased by 5.4 per cent. AMP has offered clients up to six-months in home loan repayment deferrals. Mr De Ferrari said demand for financial advice had rocketed as the economy headed towards a recession and unemployment gripped the country. ""We're responding to a record level of client enquiries for advice and support as people weigh up important financial decisions."" This comes as AMP executive Alex Wade last week called on the government and regulators to work with the superannuation industry to redesign the financial advice model, saying a free hotline or other financial literacy services would benefit Australians. Global finance firm UBS said there was ""little near-term appeal"" in buying AMP stock, as net flows appeared low but changes in the advice arm could help. ""AMP's strategy to reshape its advice and platform offerings and cut costs should assist over time though given net benefits are some way off and significant execution risks remain,"" a UBS note to clients said.

Deanne Stewart, who runs the $100 billion First State Super said it was the poor-performing, smaller funds that were most at-risk of liquidity issues. ""If you’ve gone into COVID-19 as an underperforming fund that has negative cash outflows, COVID-19 would probably exacerbate that and it's those type of funds that are likely to be struggling more,"" Ms Stewart said. ""Will it likely be a catalyst for additional mergers? I do think that it may act as a catalyst for some funds."" First State Super boss Deanne Stewart said smaller, under-performing funds were more at-risk.Credit:Photo: Dominic Lorrimer The emergency scheme, which allows people who have lost work as a result of the coronavirus to withdraw two instalments of $10,000 from their retirement savings, opened this week. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said the scheme could cause assets under management in the sector to shrink by 25 per cent, putting the liquidity of super funds to the test. Convenor of the Actuaries Institute's Superannuation Practice Committee Tim Jenkins and other experts have said funds with members who work in the hardest-hit industries such as hospitality and retail will struggle to meet demand as their members face higher unemployment levels, meaning shrinking contributions and greater withdrawals. But Ms Stewart said the larger funds with good net cash flows were in a ""really good position"" to meet withdrawal requests and it was funds struggling with cash flow before the crisis that were most at-risk. ""I think lots of the articles to date quite frankly have focused in the wrong area and on the wrong funds,"" she said. Smaller funds including Christian Super, Energy Industries Super, Maritime Super and a BT Super for Life fund were named by the prudential regulator's heat map last December as among the worst-performing funds. A spokesman for $6 billion Maritime Super said it did not have any liquidity concerns because its members, largely seafarers, were not impacted by the pandemic. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) was given greater powers to force underperforming funds to merge last April and a joint letter by the financial regulators last month called on trustees to make ""difficult decisions"" so redemption requests were able to be met. APRA said it was not at the point where funds needed to merge but acknowledged it was engaging with certain funds more closely than others over liquidity. Christian Super similarly denied problems with meeting demand for the scheme and said while there was no pressure to merger, it ""has always had an open posture on engaging with peer funds on collaboration opportunities where member interests and outcomes can be enhanced."" Meanwhile, a research project by lobby group Industry Super Australia this week claimed more than 1 million people who have not been financially impacted by the pandemic could claim access to their retirement savings. The survey of about 4000 found as many as 50 per cent of full-time employees and 37 per cent of people who said they had sufficient savings to deal with a short-term loss of income were ""very likely"" to take advantage of the early access scheme. It also found high-income earners were more likely to apply than low-income earners. ""This would not appear to be consistent with the policy intent which is to assist those in financial hardship,"" Industry Super Australia said. However, Grattan Institute superannuation expert Brendan Coates said the government's wage replacement packages would ""largely insulate"" low to middle-income earners from the economic costs of the crisis, with some actually getting a pay rise. ""But high-income earners are still heavily exposed financially if they lose their livelihoods,"" Mr Coates said. ""And since higher-income earners also have larger ongoing financial commitments like mortgages and rent, they’re more likely to need to rely on schemes like early release of super to get them through.""

Challenger reported outflows of $2.3 billion and an 8 per cent decline in total assets under management (AUM) for the quarter on Wednesday, which chief executive Richard Howes put down to the ongoing impact of the pandemic on investment markets and consumer activity. Challenger chief executive Richard Howes says coronavirus is driving down consumer demand. Credit:James Brickwood  “The drop in AUM includes the effect of major market movements in the period as well as some redemptions in funds management as superannuation funds seek liquidity to fund members switching to cash and withdrawing funds,” Mr Howes said. The ASX-listed company last month reported a $214 million profit spike that pushed its share price more than 10 per cent higher. But the pandemic has wreaked havoc on financial markets causing Challenger's assets under management (AUM) to slide to $79 billion. Challenger partners with fund manager Fidante to manage portfolios for large superannuation funds and other clients. The AUM in this arm of the business was also down 11 per cent, as Mr Howes said funds sought to rebalance portfolios to prepare for member redemptions under the government's early access scheme that opened this week. Tribeca Investment's lead portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu said the early access scheme could cause up to $20 billion in withdrawals. ""This simply means all that has to come out of funds management businesses. And we still have more to go."" But Ms Liu said Challenger had been struggling for some time and there were rumours it was due for a capital raise. ""I'm surprised as to why they haven't,"" she said. ""It was a structurally challenged business that has now been struck by this pandemic, which is only making things worse."" The financial services company is a specialty provider of annuities – a product that provides customers with an income stream during retirement – and it booked a 10 per cent slide in sales to $593 million since the corresponding period last year. Mr Howes said ""ongoing disruption"" in the financial advice sector was partly responsible for falling annuities sales but added advisers were also focused on those clients that need help with new rules around superannuation. Challenger's life insurance book grew by 0.2 per cent over the quarter, up 9 per cent since the same time last year, with growth driven by ""strong contribution from Japanese and institutional sales"".

The COVID-19 crisis is one such emergency. Being diagnosed with cancer is another. I’m supremely glad my own experiences with cancer happened after I ceased being self-employed since I recklessly never took my mentor’s advice, preferring instead to foolishly spend almost everything I earned. A diagnosis of serious illness can force an entrepreneur to make tough decisions beyond their health. Credit:Shutterstock The same cannot be said for many others who as owners of small businesses are suddenly confronted by two shocks: the cancer diagnosis being one and the need to maintain revenue for the months (and possibly years) ahead being the other. Their experiences have now been recorded in the first study of its kind to explore how entrepreneurs deal with cancer when, unlike salaried workers, they lack the security of regular income, for instance, and sick leave entitlements. Further enriching the research, the findings of which have been published in the Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation, is that counsellors were among the interviewees since their perspective, after providing therapy to many entrepreneurs diagnosed with cancer, was likewise seen as valuable. Five main themes emerged, with the entrepreneurs’ continued commitment to the firm coming out on top. In most cases they worked longer hours during the cancer treatment than their salaried counterparts. Almost every entrepreneur even continued to visit their business on a daily basis, with this being a common sentiment: “I worked 24/7 whether I was at the hospital or at home. I phoned with suppliers while receiving chemotherapy. The shop is my little baby.” Replay   Not that it’s advisable, with one of the counsellors agreeing “many self-employed work – although they should not – because they know they need to take care of the business … There are many self-employed who are rather sick and work anyway.” Which, as the scholars caution, is an unhealthy form of presenteeism. It should also be noted it was more than just workaholism that compelled them to work. It was also a desire to remain true to their passion, to avoid boredom and anxiety, and to protect their mental health via a quick return to normalcy. The second theme was in relation to the treatment and how the side effects, at least for a period of time, prevented them from working as hard, while the third theme pertained to business-related worries. The biggest worry of all centred on how to keep the business running. Like plenty of entrepreneurs, the reputation of their business was dependent on themselves – their own name and identity – the absence of which put their firm at risk. As one anxious participant put it: “I have no time to be sick! Will I lose customers? What can I do? Do I have to shut down my business?” Or as another lamented: “I wished I was an ordinary employee; then I could have been allowed just to be sick.” Shame characterised the fourth theme, mostly because of their appearance (due to hair loss, for example) and sometimes because they were now labelled a cancer sufferer or weren’t recovering as quickly as others expected. For a few the shame stemmed from the unavoidable downslide of their business; their revenues following the same trajectory as their health. It’s a good thing, then, the fifth theme was support because it was ubiquitous. Family and friends eagerly helped out – “If it hadn’t been for my husband this business wouldn’t have existed” – while clients and colleagues assisted in other ways such as being flexible, working additional hours and even the simple yet comforting gesture of sending supportive messages to wish them well. As the researchers conclude, the self-employed may be markedly different in terms of their business interests, but they’re remarkably similar when they’re seriously ill.

Almost every entrepreneur even continued to visit their business on a daily basis, with this being a common sentiment: “I worked 24/7 whether I was at the hospital or at home. I phoned with suppliers while receiving chemotherapy. The shop is my little baby.” Replay   Not that it’s advisable, with one of the counsellors agreeing “many self-employed work – although they should not – because they know they need to take care of the business … There are many self-employed who are rather sick and work anyway.” Which, as the scholars caution, is an unhealthy form of presenteeism. It should also be noted it was more than just workaholism that compelled them to work. It was also a desire to remain true to their passion, to avoid boredom and anxiety, and to protect their mental health via a quick return to normalcy. The second theme was in relation to the treatment and how the side effects, at least for a period of time, prevented them from working as hard, while the third theme pertained to business-related worries. The biggest worry of all centred on how to keep the business running. Like plenty of entrepreneurs, the reputation of their business was dependent on themselves – their own name and identity – the absence of which put their firm at risk. As one anxious participant put it: “I have no time to be sick! Will I lose customers? What can I do? Do I have to shut down my business?” Or as another lamented: “I wished I was an ordinary employee; then I could have been allowed just to be sick.” Shame characterised the fourth theme, mostly because of their appearance (due to hair loss, for example) and sometimes because they were now labelled a cancer sufferer or weren’t recovering as quickly as others expected. For a few the shame stemmed from the unavoidable downslide of their business; their revenues following the same trajectory as their health. It’s a good thing, then, the fifth theme was support because it was ubiquitous. Family and friends eagerly helped out – “If it hadn’t been for my husband this business wouldn’t have existed” – while clients and colleagues assisted in other ways such as being flexible, working additional hours and even the simple yet comforting gesture of sending supportive messages to wish them well. As the researchers conclude, the self-employed may be markedly different in terms of their business interests, but they’re remarkably similar when they’re seriously ill.

""We have engaged in discussions with our landlords and in most instances those discussions are proving fruitful, but where they are not fruitful, we are not afraid to permanently close stores or clinics,"" API chief executive Richard Vincent said in a conference call at the company's half-year results on Thursday. API chief executive Richard Vincent has pulled the pin on the possible takeover of Sigma Healthcare.Credit:Peter Braig Mr Vincent said Vicinity was the largest landlord across Australian Pharmaceutical Industries' (API's) more than 1500 sites but refused to be drawn on whether one landlord, in particular, had been slower to negotiate. ""Our conversations have been unfolding very slowly. In a lot of cases, they [landlords] have said 'we'll get to you, or a particular store, in due course'."" The company said it had decided to suspend its interim dividend until it knows more about the revenue implications of the pandemic. The company paid out 3.75 cent interim dividend in 2019 and a 4¢ final dividend. API shares dropped more than 10 per cent on Thursday to close at $1. ASX-listed API's store network includes Priceline Pharmacy, Soul Pattinson Chemists and Clear Skincare clinics across Australia and New Zealand. While many of those outlets are seeing a rise in prescription orders during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Vincent said the business could not predict the longer-term impacts amid tough consumer spending conditions and fewer shoppers in CBDs and shopping centres.  ""We think we're in for a number of years of relatively low growth,"" he said. On Thursday API reported a 2.8 per cent increase in revenue to $2 billion, although the company's earnings before interest and tax was down 11.5 per cent on the prior corresponding period to $39.3 million. Net profit fell 9.5 per cent to $22.5 million. The company's calculation of its underlying earnings before interest and tax was $41.7 million, down 6.1 per cent, while its underlying net profit after tax was down 1.9 per cent to $26.3 million. The half-year numbers largely reflect conditions prior to the outbreak of COVID-19  and the company warned it was impossible to predict the pandemic's true impact on the business. While sales of prescription medication, hair dye and vitamins were increasing, shoppers weren't browsing and adding to their baskets in the way they normally would, he said. ""I know people will try to get a read on what all of this means, but really it is fluid and it is jumping all over the place,"" Mr Vincent said. He said pharmacy distribution had experienced a significant boost since COVID-19 shutdowns.

The app is based on the TraceTogether app released by the Singaporean government in March and will use Bluetooth to identify if users have been in close proximity with one another for an extended period of time. James Cameron of venture capital firm Airtree Ventures said the app appeared to have been thoughtfully designed to protect users' privacy as data will be stored in an encrypted form and GPS and location data will not be tracked. The government's coronavirus tracking app  is demonstrated on an iPhone in Brisbane. Credit:AAP ""It’s not 100 per cent secure - no system ever is,"" Mr Cameron said. ""But the real privacy risks here are relatively low, especially when compared to the potential benefits. If done right, the app will literally save lives."" However with iPhone users making up over 50 per cent of smartphone owners in Australia, Mr Cameron warned a major design flaw in the app on iPhones could limit its effectiveness. The app doesn't run continuously in the background and it doesn't work if an iPhone is locked. Mr Cameron said these factors could see less people use the app. ""This means whenever you leave the house you need to remember to open the app and then carry your phone around in your pocket or bag, switched on and unlocked at all times,"" he said. ""With this sort of user experience, you’d expect churn to be very high. In fact, it’s likely the portion of the population actually using it in Singapore is way lower than the 20 per cent reported."" James Cameron, of Airtree Ventures, will download the app.Credit:Ryan Stuart Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said the government needs at least 40 per cent of Australians to sign up to the app for it to be effective. Estonian health tech startup Velmio has developed one of the world's first apps for coronavirus tracking and the company's chief technology officer, Sophie Wharrie, said the problem with iPhones is a critical technical limitation of the app. Replay   ""How does the Australian government plan to reach a high audience with this app when it doesn't even function properly for over half the potential users?"" she said. Apple has announced it will issue a new programming interface that will solve the issue but it won't be available until mid May at the earliest and Ms Wharrie said recent versions of Google's Android operating systems impose similar restrictions on what apps can do while running in the background. ""It’s not about the Google-Apple solution vs. Singapore solution, but rather Apple and Google need to make the necessary changes to their operating systems for even TraceTogether to function correctly,"" she said. Apple and Google are working together to release a protocol for Bluetooth tracing apps that will run natively on the phone’s operating system and can be integrated into other apps so it could be built into the TraceTogether app. SquarePeg's Paul Bassat said Australians should sign up to the app despite the technical limitations. ""An easy approach would be to take the feed from Google and Apple rather than creating our own app,"" he said. ""Nothing precludes the government from taking that data feed when it is available. Even when it is not the perfect solution, it is the right thing for us to download the app. We are downloading to restore our civil liberties.""

The travel giant was facing a potential class action lawsuit after customers complained about the $300 per person fee for cancelling flights booked before the coronavirus outbreak, as well as a 12-week delay for refund payouts. Adam Glezer was among disgruntled Flight Centre customers considering lodging a class action to get their money back. Credit:Eddie Jim Some customers have had their refunds reduced to zero as a result of the cancellation fees, while others with large groups have been asked to pay thousands of dollars in fees or take a travel credit instead. In a letter to customers on Friday morning, Flight Centre said cancellation fees would be capped at $600 for international bookings for two or more customers. Domestic travel cancellation fees will be capped at $100 per booking rather than $50 per person. The company also extended the expiry date for using travel credits from July 2021 to December 2021, after the initial 12-month deadline was widely criticised. Many customers have declined the offer of a travel credit, believing it to be useless if travel restrictions are still in place. The company’s financial difficulties have also left some customers questioning whether vouchers will be lost. The company said those who accepted a voucher could get a refund, without having to pay fees, at the end of December 2021. Flight Centre acknowledged the 12-week delay for refunds had caused significant anxiety among travellers but that airlines, not the travel agent, were to blame for the hold up. ""We are extremely appreciative of your understanding in this difficult time, and we apologise for any inconvenience and frustration you may be feeling,"" executive general manager Allisa O’Connell said. Before this latest effort Flight Centre has defended the $300 fee – which was included in its terms and conditions – saying it covers lost commission, as well as the time and cost involved in managing the refund process. Flight Centre's said bookings fell to 20-30 per cent of their normal volumes in March.Credit:Steven Siewert The embattled travel group is closing 428 Australian stores by the end of July in an attempt to radically slash costs while raising $900 million in fresh equity and debt to last it through the coronavirus pandemic. Adam Glezer, who had booked a trip to Israel via Europe for his sister's wedding through Flight Centre subsidiary BYOJet, was among the customers considering mounting a class action. He said hundreds of people had put their hand up to be part of the class action. For a deposit for a cancelled cruise in Italy, Mr Glezer was offered either a $600 credit or a $600 refund - minus the $600 cancellation fee - for a net return of zero.

The company is facing intense criticism from customers over a $300 per person fee for cancelling flights booked before the outbreak, as well as 12-week delays for refund payouts and offers of travel credits instead. Adam Glezer has banded together with other disgruntled Flight Centre customers to investigate whether to lodge a class action to get their money back. Credit:Eddie Jim Little or no communication from Flight Centre – which is under significant financial pressure due to widespread travel bans – has added to widespread anxiety that customers might not get their money back. The cancellation fee has seen some customers have their refunds reduced to zero and could soon be the subject of a class action, with law firms considering taking on the case. Melbourne man Adam Glezer has banded together with Sydney resident Eran Ben-Avraham, a former Flight Centre employee and now disgruntled customer, to investigate the viability of a lawsuit against the company. Mr Glezer, who had booked a trip to Israel via Europe for his sister's wedding through Flight Centre subsidiary Travel Associates, said hundreds of people had put their hand up to be part of the class action. For a deposit for a cancelled Italian cruise he was planning to take with his wife, Mr Glezer was offered either a $600 credit or a $600 refund which, minus the $600 cancellation fee, would give him a net return of zero. ""If the ACCC had done something about Flight Centre then there would be no reason for us to come in and shake things up,"" he said. ""I won’t say it falls on deaf ears, but the reality is nothing has happened."" A Flight Centre spokesman said the company was not in a position to comment on a possible future class action, and that it continued to ""review our policies and listen to feedback – both positive and negative."" Customers have voiced their displeasure about Flight Centre in several groups on social media, with many expressing scepticism about the company holding on to refunds with its future under a cloud. The embattled travel group is closing 428 Australian stores by the end of July in an attempt to radically slash costs while raising $900 million in fresh equity and debt to last it through the coronavirus pandemic. Flight Centre has defended the $300 fee — which was included in its terms and conditions — saying it covers lost commission, as well as the time and cost involved in managing the refund process. The company has offered travel credits without the cancellation fee, although travel restrictions have made refunds most people's preferred option. Many customers say they will never use the company again. Melbourne woman Allana O'Dea said she was waiting on a refund of nearly $7000 after flights to Bali to see her partner, who was coming from the UK, were cancelled. ""They're literally holding onto what's got to be close to millions of dollars of people's money and holding it to ransom,"" she said. In documents filed with the ASX this month, Flight Centre told investors the company’s business model was significantly dependent on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Flight Centre's said bookings fell to 20-30 per cent of their normal volumes in March.Credit:Steven Siewert It also highlighted that there may be a regulatory risk stemming from ""the imposition of cancellation fees or charges during the COVID-19 crisis"". The shutdown has left consumers with few options to have their case heard, with civil tribunals in Victoria and NSW postponing non-critical matters. Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive Gerard Brody said the episode showed the inherent imbalance in the system that allows traders to take advantage of the situation. ""We need a real look at the forum to rebalance the power between consumer and businesses,"" he said.

Low demand for fuel due to the coronavirus pandemic has sent global oil markets into turmoil, with a supply glut driving crude oil prices into the negative for the first time, trading as low as negative $US40 ($63). Since the beginning of the year, overall crude oil prices have decreased by $US50 per barrel. Replay   This decrease has been reflected in Australian wholesale petrol prices but has not fully flowed through to petrol bowsers, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) warned on Wednesday. While wholesale petrol prices have dropped 50 cents per litre since the start of the year, average petrol prices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth have fallen only 45 cents per litre. The average metropolitan price is at 97.7¢ per litre, according to RACV. Australia's consumer watchdog has put the hard word on petrol retailers, instructing them to pass on the benefits of record oil prices.Credit:Luis Enrique Ascui ""In the larger Australian capital cities, petrol retailers took too long to pass on the savings from the rapid drop in international oil prices, and this did not reflect well on them,"" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. ""The drop in the crude oil price is good news for the Australian motorists. At this time the Australian economy needs all the assistance it can get and lower world crude oil prices are one of the few positives from current world events."" However, major fuel retailers have warned against expecting cheap petrol prices, saying the coronavirus has cut demand by up to 50 per cent in recent weeks and sellers still have high operating costs such as transport as well as paying the government's 41 cent fuel excise. Regional petrol stations along with retailers in Darwin and Canberra were far less consistent in dropping prices, Mr Sims said. Reduced competition in regional areas can cause price changes to lag as much as six weeks behind capital city operators. The ACCC advised motorists to shop around for the best price and send a ""strong message"" to petrol stations that have not yet passed on the price decreases. It advised shoppers to use price comparison apps and websites to ensure they are getting the best deal. With 37 per cent of petrol station profits made from convenience goods, ACCC boss Rod Sims has advised shoppers against a cheeky chocolate bar or meat pie on their way home.Credit:AAP    ""Especially at this difficult time, retailers must not take advantage of the situation to increase their profits, but should pass on savings to motorists,"" Mr Sims said. The ACCC also released the findings of its latest report into the petrol industry, which found profits for major petrol retailers and station operators such as BP, Caltex, Coles, Woolworths and 7-Eleven have jumped significantly in recent years. In 2017 to 2018 net profits across all fuel products, convenience store and non-fuel services were $616 million. A record-high $333 million was made on petrol products alone, representing a 3¢ per litre net profit. This is almost double the average 1.6 cents per litre profit made by petrol stations from 2008 to 2014. Sixty per cent of petrol profits were made on premium fuel, which Mr Sims said had a ""significantly higher profit margin"". Convenience store sales brought in 37 per cent of total net profits. ""Drivers who have the option can save money by resisting the temptation of convenience foods at petrol stations and using regular unleaded petrol, although motorists should follow their car manufacturers’ advice,"" Mr Sims said.

56,/business/workplace/it-s-the-economy-and-you-are-not-stupid-20200422-p54ma1.html,"It's the economy, and you are not stupid","The impact of the coronavirus on the economy and our working hours can be perplexing. Credit:Jamie Brown Question This might be the stupidest question you ever receive, but what do people mean when they talk about “the economy”? Last week my whole team had a Zoom meeting with our head of department and he said something like, “You all need to go to less days a week. That’s just the reality of the economy at the moment.” I’ve heard other pundits talk in the last months about “wrecking the economy” and “saving the economy”. This has got me to thinking I don’t really know what it means. Online definitions only confuse me more. Am I just dumb? Work TherapyCredit:John Shakespeare  Answer I have to disagree that your question is unintelligent and the expert whose help I’ve sought on this subject agrees. Saul Eslake is an independent economist and Vice-Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Tasmania. “I don’t think it’s a stupid question at all. I suspect it crosses more than a few people’s minds from time to time,” he told me. “There are, of course, any number of dictionary definitions which do not, in my opinion, fully capture what economists understand by it.” Saul offered one of his own, but said it was important to look at each component of the definition to get a good sense of what an economy really was. “It’s the set of arrangements by which people, and entities established by people, are able to create, acquire and exchange things that they value.” The people in this definition might be individuals or groups of individuals, such as families. But it could also refer to much larger groups – the populations of entire regions, states or countries. Entities refer to organisations such as unions, clubs and societies, as well as governments and businesses. As for the things in Saul’s definition, they come in two main categories: goods and services. Goods might be food and drinks, clothes, books or paintings. Examples of services are health, education, travel, entertainment, cleaning and haircuts. Saul reminded us that it’s important to count a person’s own services – his or her labour – in the “things” definition, as well as investments such as stocks, bonds and other assets. Creating, Saul explained, refers to producing things by any means – it might be “physical labour, mental effort [or] artistic endeavour”. Acquire usually refers to purchasing or renting, although in some circumstances you might acquire a thing thanks to an act of benevolence or because it’s funded by tax. Exchange might refer to purchasing and renting, as well, but also to selling and leasing. Most exchanges are voluntary but some, such as the payment of taxes, are not. Value in an economy is “usually, but not always, expressed in monetary terms ... But there can also be direct exchanges of goods and services, sometimes called bartering. And in some cases, the value may be spiritual, emotional or in some other way intangible.” Finally, there are the rules, regulations, customs and protocols that govern the creation, acquisition and exchange of things. These are the arrangements of the definition; they “may be established by Parliaments which pass laws, regulators, police forces and courts which interpret and enforce laws, and by habits and modes of behaviour built up over long periods of time”. I think this last point gets to the heart of your question. In Saul’s words, it underscores the important point that ""the economy"" exists with both a human – or social – and a physical – or natural – construct. What is “the economy”? Saul said there isn’t really one. And when you settle on the one you want to talk about, it's often not something you can point to or easily conjure a picture of in your mind. “Every society – that is, every group of people – has an economy. Economies vary enormously in terms of sophistication and complexity, just as human societies do. Like human societies, economies are constantly changing, exhibiting both short-term fluctuations and longer-term trends. Like human societies, they can be influenced, for better or worse, by conscious human actions, usually undertaken through collective entities such as governments, although sometimes also by individuals or groups of individuals who are able to exercise significant power. And, as we are again being reminded right now, like human societies, economies can be influenced, again for better or worse, by completely random or unpredicted turns of events. You’re definitely not “dumb” because you're unsure about what people mean when they use this term. Perhaps, though, others need to be more careful and not quite so presumptuous when discussing such an intricate and involved subject. Got a question about work, or something that affects your job?

57,/business/workplace/know-your-rights-and-stand-up-to-unjustified-staff-stand-downs-20200422-p54m7o.html,Know your rights and stand up to unjustified staff stand downs,"Over the last month, we have become all-too-familiar with a very old concept in employment law: stand downs. Government restrictions to contain COVID-19 have had a devastating economic impact, leading to widespread business closures and changes to operations. Employers have been faced with very difficult decisions about what happens to their staff. Stand downs – requiring employees not to attend or perform work for a period of time, and not paying them – have been a widespread business response to the crisis. Unemployment queues in Australia in 1935 and then in March 2020.Credit:State Library of NSW/Jason South My preliminary trawl of media reports over the period from March 19 to April 20 revealed that stand downs have been put in place by businesses across the economy, particularly in: aviation, tourism, resources, hospitality, sport, gaming, retail, the arts, entertainment, leisure, media, healthcare, local government and secondary education. These media reports indicated that a total of 136,585 employees and a much larger unspecified number had been stood down. The true figure is hard to pin down, but it is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey showed that 9 per cent of businesses had stood down staff or put them on unpaid leave by early April. And the Grattan Institute has forecast that between 1.9 and 3.43 million could be forced out of work in the period ahead (with stood down workers forming part of that number). There is no question that many of these stand downs have been part of a necessary business response to the pandemic. But in some cases, stand downs may not have met the requirements of the Fair Work Act: that employees cannot be usefully employed because of a stoppage of work for which the employer cannot reasonably be held responsible. This test will clearly have been met, for example where a restaurant or cafe has had to close indefinitely in accordance with stage three restrictions. On the other hand, what about an IT or engineering firm that has lost contracts, but still has work available for some staff on other projects? Or regional newspapers that have stood down staff after axing their print editions, but are still producing an online publication? Very few stand downs are being contested. However, through dispute proceedings in the Fair Work Commission, the Independent Education Union has obtained a back-down from a college on a proposed stand down of teachers. The IEU’s argument is that there is other valuable work these employees could be doing, and some employers are opportunistically using the crisis to balance their books through unnecessary stand downs. Employer stand down powers have been bolstered through the legislation implementing the federal government’s JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme. A business that is receiving the $1500 JobKeeper payment for an employee can direct the employee not to work, or to work a reduced number of hours, if they cannot be usefully employed as normal. This situation must have arisen because of necessary business changes attributable to the pandemic or government initiatives to slow the transmission of COVID-19. This is an easier test to satisfy than the one in the Fair Work Act, which includes the difficult to define concept of a ""stoppage of work"" as a trigger for stand downs. Even so, a JobKeeper-related stand down direction must not be ""unreasonable in all the circumstances"". This could provide a basis for challenging, for example, stand downs of certain employees in a workplace rather than others – where there is no legitimate business rationale for this decision. Then there is the treatment of workers once stood down. Under the Fair Work Act, the effect of a stand down  is that the employee is not paid but continues to accrue annual and personal leave. This is ameliorated to some extent by JobKeeper, which will ensure that those stood down receive at least $1500 a fortnight (where they and their employers are eligible for the scheme). Some businesses have required staff to draw on their annual leave or long-service leave entitlements while stood down. JobKeeper facilitates this, by enabling an employer to request that a JobKeeper recipient take paid annual leave – as long as the employee will still have at least a two-week leave balance – a request that the employee ""must not unreasonably refuse"". Another area of dispute has been sick leave. Unions have initiated a Federal Court action against Qantas over its refusal to allow its 20,000 stood-down staff to access their sick leave entitlements. This includes those with long-standing illnesses or injuries and those who have been exposed to coronavirus. The airline relies on a technical legal argument that employees cannot be unfit for work (and therefore on sick leave) when there is no work to be absent from (because of stand downs). But there is an equally plausible argument that if annual leave is available to stood-down workers under the Fair Work Act, then so is sick leave. Some might say that the Qantas workers should consider themselves lucky to be in a job, given the plight now facing their counterparts at Virgin which entered into administration this week. The supposed ""Team Australia"" moment created by this crisis should not be considered a green light for the mistreatment of workers, especially those who are most vulnerable. Vigilance is needed to ensure that there is a proper legal basis for all stand downs, and in the application of the very wide new powers given to employers under the JobKeeper rules.

Like other countries battling to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, Australia is facing a sharp rise in unemployment. The spotlight will be on the health of the office market post the coronavirusCredit:Peter Braig Morgan Stanley economists expect unemployment to increase to 9 per cent in 2020, settling around 7.9 per cent by the end of the year. Other estimates say it could rise higher. The mass layoff of workers will cause a substantial reduction in demand for office space in the short term and reduced expectations over the medium term. That is likely to push vacancy above 10 per cent in Sydney and Melbourne, according to UBS analyst Grant McCasker. ""This will see a substantial increase in incentives, of about a 50 per cent increase in Sydney and Melbourne and reduction in face rents of 10 per cent over the next 12-18 months,"" he said in a note to clients. The job cuts will also result in net effective rents for prime offices falling up to 20 per cent over the next 12 months, UBS estimates. Savills Australia’s Melbourne leasing head Mark Rasmussen said tenant inquiry has slowed substantially across the city centre as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, but there was an upside – a significant rise in inquiry from both state and federal governments. “Most private businesses are avoiding any decisions if they can,” he said. The lockdown and shift to home working is fundamentally reshaping how businesses view their use of space. Smaller businesses, that had previously refused to let staff work from home, were now actively considering downsizing their office requirements. “There is certainly going to be more people looking at the option of working from home,” he said. But Mr Rasmussen says while vacancy will rise, ""it’s not going to be a bloodbath.” Most large city corporates, particularly banks and global consulting firms, were already well down the journey of introducing flexible works systems, a fact that would dilute the impact of any coronavirus-inspired change. “In prime grade buildings vacancy will stay fairly low but we will see a substantial increase in incentives,” he predicted. Melbourne’s prime grade vacancy is expected to rise to around 5 per cent by mid-2021, but now it may top 6 per cent. Overall, landlords will be very reluctant to drop rents, he said. Morgan Stanley's analysts are more bearish. The bank predicts Sydney’s office vacancy will rise above 10 per cent as unemployment escalates. ""What's more concerning is that there is almost a 0.7 per cent correlation between NSW job ads and Sydney CBD office net absorption based on data since 2007,"" the bank said. Despite the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, big tenants are hunting for new digs with some seeing an opportunity to get more space at a better rent. Collectively Westpac, Australia Post and the Commonwealth Bank are in the market for about 100,000 square metres in Sydney and Melbourne. Westpac began its search for 40,000 sq m late last year and will likely review those specifications once the full impact of the virus is known and it can assess how many staff wish to keep working from home. In Melbourne, the Commonwealth Bank is in the market for 18,000 sq m. It currently has staff located at 357 Collins Street and in Lang Walker’s Mercer building in the Docklands. Australia Post has a requirement for 40,000 sq m in Melbourne and is actively reconsidering its head lease at 111 Bourke Street, a building owned by Brookfield Asset Management. Also in the marketplace, is the state government’s Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal which needs a new 20,000 sq m home.

MCR was also keen to empower young women through its architecture.Credit:  Toorak College for girls was established in 1897 in Toorak. However, shortly after, it moved to Mt Eliza to allow the students to have a healthier life by the sea. “We wanted to respond to these buildings, but obviously take STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) into a contemporary scheme,” says Deb Ryan, Principal of McBride Charles Ryan (MCR) Architecture + Interior Design. Hudson and Wardrop’s Arts & Crafts-style buildings have a strong English feel, with steep gabled roofs and tall chimneys. The main administration wing, with its stucco tower, is a reminder of the school’s past. MCR‘s scheme, the result of a limited competition, responded to both Hudson and Wardrop design, with its cloistered courtyard, as much as to Edna Walling’s gardens. MCR was also keen to empower young women through its architecture. “If you look at where many of the jobs will be in the future, it’s in the STEM fields,” says Ryan. As with many of the historic buildings on the senior school campus, each elevation has its own unique characteristics. Likewise, the new STEM wing, almost embracing the manicured sporting lawns, has four differently treated facades. The southern elevation, for example, comprises seven different coloured bricks, from beige through to grey and windows beautifully detailed with crevices to speak to a more ornate style from the past. The main auditorium features a laser cut MDF ceiling with a floral motif.Credit:  “We didn’t want STEM to ‘scream attention’ from the street. It’s more of a quiet contemporary reference,” says Ryan. However, the STEM wing’s northern elevation, with its dramatic curved facade and rhythmic placement of windows that comes as a surprise. “The starting point was slicing into a cylindrical cone and tilting it on its side,” says Ryan. Entering STEM is akin to stepping into a brave new world. The main auditorium, for example, features a laser cut MDF ceiling with a floral motif and is lined with fabric for acoustic control. Here, again, the homage to Edna Walling is apparent. “Nature is an important part of the STEM program,” she adds. The main ‘streetscape’, with its west and east entrances, is also fresh and contemporary with sinuous snake-like seating in bright red upholstery snaking itself from one end to the other. Loosely arranged chairs and tables allow students to study informally or simply catch up. “We wanted the spaces to be engaging as well as comfortable and offering a level of flexibility,” says Ryan. The two ‘super labs’ adjacent to these breakout spaces, are also flanked by a variety of seating arrangements for students. “We also wanted to make the labs pleasurable to be in, rather than feeling clinical,’ says Ryan, a tour-de-force when it comes to colour having created a strong dose of blue walls in the mix. One of the most powerful spaces in the STEM design is the boardroom, a domain often given over to men. “We wanted to allow these young women to know how it felt to occupy a space that’s not always readily accessible,” says Ryan, pointing out the impressive distant views over Port Phillip Bay. Used by both staff and students, the boardroom was also delivered with great comfort, with chairs and furniture that could easily be found in a boardroom. MCR also considered each pathway to offer an experience rather than simply a means of navigating the building. The dramatic timber-battened spotted gum timber staircase connecting the two levels, frames an outdoor laboratory as well as further activating this new wonder. “The starting point was about the history of the original buildings, but at the same time setting up young women to embrace the STEM fields as much as contemporary architecture,” adds Ryan.

BHP chief executive Mike Henry said although demand in China had ""strengthened in recent weeks"", the miner expected other major economies including the United States, Europe and India to contract ""sharply"" in the June 2020 quarter due to the impact of the virus. ""The situation remains fluid,"" he said. ""However, with our strong financial position and low-cost operations, our business is resilient, with capacity to generate solid cash flow through this period and emerge well-placed as the global economy recovers."" A reclaimer at the ore stockpile at the BHP Jimblebar facility in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.Credit:Tony McDonough BHP's output of steelmaking commodity iron ore – the nation's top export – has held up in the March quarter, with the miner producing 68 million tonnes of the ore from mines in Western Australia, company figures released on Tuesday showed. The miner added that the output was unchanged from the December quarter and meant it was on track to meet its full-year targets of 273 million and 286 million tonnes. However, BHP warned on Tuesday that all guidance was ""subject to potential impacts"" of COVID-19 in the June 2020 quarter. It comes as the market for iron ore has remained strong this year with prices above $US80 a tonne, despite the onset of the coronavirus crippling activity across much of China – by far the biggest customer base for Australian iron ore miners – as steel mills kept producing, and supply disruptions emerged in other iron ore-exporting nations. BHP and Australia's other top miners, so far, have been largely spared from virus-related restrictions hampering their domestic operations, regularly meeting with authorities and introducing strict protocols at their airports and mines to bolster hygiene, ensure physical distancing and minimise infection. Elsewhere in BHP’s portfolio of mining assets, however, coronavirus restrictions and lockdowns have affected the outlook for its jointly-owned Antamina copper mine in Peru and the Cerrejon energy coal mine in Colombia. While production targets for its wholly-owned copper assets remained ""broadly unchanged"", BHP said its Antamina and energy coal targets had now been placed under review. In response to the economic impact of coronavirus, BHP on Tuesday said it would scale back its $8 billion spending budget previously set for the 2021 financial year, with details to be given in August. Mr Henry said BHP had implemented ""extensive measures across our operations"" to ensure its people and communities remained safe from COVID-19. ""I am encouraged to know that the small number of colleagues from our 72,000 strong global workforce who have tested positive for the virus have recovered or are recovering well,"" he said. ""The coupling of our disciplined controls, the commitment of people across BHP, and our financial strength has enabled us to continue to safely operate and supply our customers with the critical resources they require, and to continue to provide jobs and an underpinning of economic activity both locally and around the world."" Macquarie analysts said the $8 billion spending cut would likely delay BHP's Scarborough venture with Woodside off the coast of WA as well as a slower spend at its Spence open-cut copper mine in Chile. Analyst Hayden Bairstow said BHP's results were solid with output of most key commodities falling within 2 per cent of Macquarie's forecasts. ""Metallurgical coal was the only meaningful area of weakness with production of most mines in Queensland coming in below our estimates,"" he said. ""The guidance reviews for Antamina and Cerrejon were expected given previously announced COVID-19-related disruptions."" Business reporter for The Age and Sydney Morning Herald.

""We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing a number of measures aligned to our priorities of keeping our people safe and well, maintaining reliable operations and supporting our communities,"" South32 chief executive Graham Kerr said. ""We have acted to protect our strong financial position, reducing capital and exploration expenditure, suspending our on-market share buy-back and commencing a group-wide review aimed at delivering a reduction in controllable costs."" South32 on Monday reported a decline in production across most of the commodities it extracts due to government restrictions, introduced around the world, aimed at arresting the spread of the deadly pandemic.The miner has recently pulled production guidance for its operations in South Africa and Colombia where governments have introduced nationwide lockdowns, and had lowered its guidance for its Australian manganese operations by 5 per cent. South32 on Monday said it had been given government approval to restart limited activity at its South African manganese and thermal coal operations during the lockdown period at a ""reduced rate"". The company has maintained financial year 2020 production targets for ""all other operations"", saying production and sales had so far been unaffected by responses to coronavirus. ""At our operations, we have delivered a strong operating result in the year to date,"" Mr Kerr said. Across South32's biggest commodities, over the three months to March 31, the company's alumina production declined 4 per cent to 1.2 million tonnes and aluminium production fell 1 per cent to 245,000 tonnes Thermal coal declined 1 per cent to 5.8 million tonnes and metallurgical coal slid 3 per cent to 1.1 million tonnes.
