Inside the race for a COVID-19 game-changer,"In a sprawling laboratory in Melbourne, an army of robots is joining the fight against COVID-19. The mission? To scan hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds, faster than humanly possible, searching for the “needle in the haystack” – the one that can be turned into a lifesaving drug against a dangerous and fast-moving new virus. Meanwhile, further down the corridors of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI), scientists are preparing to test not just how an existing drug might slow the new infection – but whether it can stop it taking hold altogether. And, next door at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, a huge trial is kicking off that will mean most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia and New Zealand can already opt in to an experimental treatment. A robot scans chemical compounds at the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute. This is just one stretch of the global frontline against COVID-19. The quest for a vaccine offering immunity from the new coronavirus has already been labelled this century’s space race, such is its speed. But moving just as fast is the hunt for a drug to treat it. Nobel-prize winning immunologist Professor Peter Doherty is hopeful the world will get its jab of immunity soon. But even the most optimistic predictions put a vaccine roll out into 2021. While we wait, treatments, ranging from existing drugs repurposed from the medicine cabinet to those that can stop the new virus infecting people in the first place, offer another road out of danger, he says. So what are the main therapy strategies and the most promising trials? And what about Donald Trump's drug of choice: hydroxychloroquine? Professor Marc Pellegrini says the National Drug Discovery Centre at WEHI is now focusing its huge drug screening capability on finding a cure for COVID-19.Credit:Cameron Wells/WEHI This virus has never been seen before in humans. There's still a lot we don't know about it and the illness it causes COVID-19, and most of our cells know even less. We don't have any natural immunity to fight it off and there's no known medical treatment or cure. ""None yet, anyway,"" says virologist and director at the Doherty Institute Professor Sharon Lewin. But there are two main ways to defeat a virus, she explains. You can stop it in its tracks directly with a drug that disrupts how the microbe hacks into our cellular machinery. Or you can help bodies cope with the invasion, ramping up or, more commonly in the case of a new unfamiliar pathogen, dampening down the immune system’s response as required. This stops the virus either overwhelming our body’s defences or sparking an overreaction, the kind that can spiral into what’s known as a ""cytokine storm"" as too many virus-fighting antibodies are called to the fight and our organs become collateral damage. This storm is already playing out in hospital wards across the world as patients' lungs and even hearts and kidneys start to fail under COVID-19. Some drugs could work on both the virus and our immune response, Lewin says. That includes the much-hyped anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Infectious disease clinician Professor Marc Pellegrini admits that, while the drug is already used safely to treat auto-immune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, researchers still aren't completely clear how it works. ""We think it can modulate the immune system so it might stop that initial blunderbuss immune defence we know can often do more harm than good, particularly in the case of a new virus,"" Pellegrini says. ""But in the lab it's also been shown to stop the virus replicating in cells."" Still, like those overzealous antibodies, against COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine could do more harm than good. Its among the therapies being considered because the fastest route to treating a new virus is to find an existing drug that can do the job, one already widely used with its own well-understood applications (and side-effects). The World Health Organisation launched an international ""mega trial"" known as SOLIDARITY on March 18, testing the four drugs it ruled had the most promise: an antiviral called Remdesivir that failed on Ebola but has shown some of the most encouraging early results against COVID-19; the anti-HIV drug combo Lopinavir/Ritonavir known as Kaletra; Inteferon, which is used to regulate the immune system and treat multiple sclerosis; and a late addition, following hype from the media and the US President, hydroxychloroquine. The trials are not double-blinded, the preferred gold standard, meaning patients taking part will know if they get an experimental treatment or if they're in ""the control group"" with just the current supportive care options. But scientists say the need for a fast roll-out and the large size of the new trials trump the risk of a placebo effect. They expect they will have meaningful results within months, even weeks. There's another less talked about possibility. In the race for either a vaccine or a treatment, scientists may find a therapy that can do both by stopping the virus taking hold in the first place. As Pellegrini explains: ""If you find a drug that stops the virus replicating and you give it to someone early enough, you can actually stop them getting infected."" Doherty agrees such drugs, which he likens to the preventative tablets taken to stop HIV infections, could be a gamechanger, offering a protective shield for at-risk groups such as the elderly or healthcare workers while the world waits for a vaccine. ""The earliest I've heard [for a vaccine] is still looking like 2021, we can't lock down that long,"" he says. ""Treatments, but also something that prevents the infection, like the HIV PreP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] drugs you take twice a day, could get us out of this earlier."" Trials are now underway all around the world to find such a dual-action chemical. In some, healthcare workers are given a course of hydroxychloroquine over many weeks or months, at a lower dose than in trials testing the drug on infected patients. Scientists are making no promises – a chemical that can kill the virus in a test tube will not necessarily stop it replicating in a human throat, says Pellegrini, who is leading one such prevention trial in Melbourne for WEHI, which will be double-blinded. But, if they succeed, will we all take one tablet a day to keep coronavirus at bay? Not according to researchers. Such a prevention drug would likely only be given to those deemed high risk or already exposed, the way the antiviral Tamiflu is sometimes given to people in close contact with an influenza case. ""All drugs have side-effects, especially if given to a big population,"" Pellegrini says. ""So, especially now the virus is not spreading as widely here in the community, if we find something that works and that's safe, you'd still want to target it to mini-outbreaks or people at risk, say, in aged care homes or healthcare workers."" ""Multi-pronged attack"": Scientists screening less common drugs for COVID-19 potential at WEHI say they might not get there first but it's important to have a back-up plan if one drug fails.Credit:WEHI Then there's work underway into whether immunity could be temporarily ""borrowed"" from recovered patients via antibodies in their blood. Successfully fighting off a virus leaves us armed with these tiny warrior proteins in case it comes back, usually conferring at least a period of immunity (if not always a lifelong shield). The idea is you could perform a kind of transfusion from survivor to patient, spinning out the blood plasma with the antibodies inside. There are lingering questions about just how many antibodies our bodies produce against COVID-19 and how long they last. But hospitals in the US are already running trials of blood plasma donations from survivors for critically ill patients. Of course, if it works, there will be another hurdle to pass – supply. The current survivors, however generous, cannot donate enough blood plasma to inoculate the world. ""We could make antibodies specific for the virus, we do [that] all the time,"" Doherty adds. ""We grow them in enormous quantities in vats."" Creating our own custom antibodies against COVID-19 comes with its own lengthy testing – and takes us back into the realm of vaccine development. At the very least, survivors of the virus now carry in their veins crucial molecular clues for both inoculation and drug therapy. To find out which drugs will work best against a new pathogen, scientists have to first play detective. Professor Mark von Itzstein, who heads the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University, says designing a drug to kill off the virus directly means finding a good target for the attack – usually the protein that the virus uses to break into human cells and start making copies of itself. In this case, the much talked about spike protein. A number of drugs have since emerged that show promise against the virus and its spiky weapon – killing it off at least in test tubes. ""We've been screening a lot of those, and already getting some hits,"" von Itztein says. ""We've got some low-hanging fruit I'm desperate to evaluate immediately. If we can show drugs are not toxic at the doses needed to kill this virus [or] get prevention drugs up too to protect our first responders from infection, we could save lives.” A huge clinical trial led by the Doherty Institute has now been assembled across 70 hospitals in Australia and 11 in New Zealand, meaning most COVID-19 patients in the region will be able to opt in for an experimental treatment. Dubbed the ASCOT trial, it will test two drugs, at least to start with: hydroxychloroquine and the HIV therapy Kaletra. Both have been shown to stop the virus replicating in the lab and have been approved for ""compassionate use"" by doctors with nothing else in their toolkit in some parts of the world including the US. But these human trials have so far been fairly small-scale, yielding mixed results. At least 75 per cent of the trial participants will be given one of the drugs. Of those, a third will get a combination of the two, which researchers hope might improve the odds. Even before doctors began trying it out in COVID-19 wards – and US President Donald Trump told Americans to go out and take it – the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine had drawn interest early into the pandemic because it had been shown to kill the virus in test tubes, infectious disease clinician Steven Tong says. It comes with a good safety record against autoimmune diseases and is cheap and easily taken in tablet form. How it might stop a COVID-19 infection in animals or people is another story. Often what looks good under a microscope will fail or even make things worse in a human. The drug's side-effects can include heart problems, which is of particular concern, some experts say, because COVID-19 is known to attack the heart. One small trial of the drug on COVID-19 patients in France claimed to have a 100 per cent success rate but this was later disproved when serious problems with the research design emerged, including the fact one patient had died. Still, that didn't stop the hype. A larger study which has not yet been put through rigorous peer review has since suggested the drug does not reduce the risk of a COVID-19 patient deteriorating at all, and even hinted it might have exacerbated organ damage when given to a number of veterans hospitalised with the illness in the US. But, once again, experts have raised concerns about the study's design, including Professor Pellegrini who says the drug may have only been given to the sickest patients already in decline and so results should be interpreted with caution. Right now, hydroxychloroquine is available only with a prescription and should not be taken except under medical advice. A different form of the compound, which is not safe for humans, is sold as fish-tank cleaner. After Trump told people to try hydroxychloroquine (""What have you got to lose?"" he said), one man in Arizona took the fish cleaner, and died. Associate Professor Steven Tong is leading the trial from the Royal Melbourne Hospital and says the team will be keeping a close eye on other trials and lab studies around the world. Drugs showing promise can be added into the mix, pending supply. Nothing has been shown to work yet, all researchers stress – it's not time to rush out to a pharmacy or doctor. ASCOT had hoped to include another frontrunner, the intravenous drug Remdesivir, but was knocked back by the company that makes it, Gilead, due to supply issues. Gilead is rationing the drug for trials in countries with more patients, the Australian team says, but if more becomes available, it too might be tested here over the next 12-18 months. (Though a draft report from the WHO trial reportedly suggests it may not be the wonderdrug the world is hoping for). The ASCOT trial is designed to adapt as more information comes to hand - a drug performing well can be given to more patients while something reacting poorly or even causing harm can be dropped entirely. This antiviral didn't have much luck when it was deployed on the ground last year against an Ebola outbreak in the Congo and it's not yet widely used. But because it works by blocking a crucial protein that many viruses use to copy themselves, it's considered a broad antiviral – in the lab it also killed SARS and MERS, the other two dangerous coronaviruses to emerge in humans in the modern era. Against the virus that causes COVID-19, it also worked in both mice and cells in a dish. Some experts have theorised it will work best in the early stages of an infection but, because it has to be given to patients intravenously, it is unlikely to be deployed in mild cases. It is now being tested against COVID-19 overseas, including in China and the US, and is already widely approved for compassionate use by doctors - causing shortages of the drug that led its manufactuer to deny trials in both Australia and the UK access for testing. But on April 24, The Guardian reported the WHO had accidentally released a draft report into the first full trial of the drug early - and the document, which had not yet been peer-reviewed, showed it failed to help patients.  Back to the robots. As with many labs around the world, WEHI is now drawing on huge chemical databases to see if a drug that can fight COVID-19 might already on its books, even from the scrap heap of previous medical trials. ""Maybe there's a drug designed for a skin rash that didn't work on that but passed human trials,"" Pellegrini says. ""It might just kill COVID-19 or keep a cell alive against it."" To find this coveted compound, researchers are turning to artificial intelligence, machines that can run around the clock on a miniaturised scale not possible for humans, mixing different chemicals with viruses and cells, and using computer algorithms to decide which reactions look promising. The institute's new National Drug Discovery Centre is home to the largest screening effort in Australia. Pellegrini likens it to a factory assembling cars. “We can’t promise we’ll find a miracle drug, more likely it will help against the next pandemic,” he says. While the drug candidates already in trials had been quickly picked out from a screening of ""the usual suspects"", he stresses much is still not understood about the way COVID-19 operates. “So we need to cast our net wide too, and search as much as we can. We're throwing everything at it.” Another drug that has hit headlines after showing some virus-destroying power in test tubes is Ivermectin, commonly used to treat head lice and other parasites. It too already comes with a strong safety record as a prescribed medicine. But infectious disease clinician Steven Tong points out that the dose required to kill the new virus may be far too high to safely give to humans. The ASCOT trial is waiting on some extra lab studies before making a decision on whether to test it in patients. Fresh studies suggest the dose required to stop the virus may be up to 50 times the amount safe for humans.  Further north in Queensland, Professor von Itzstein is taking a different approach to fast-track screening. ""We're doing a broad look too, it may turn out to be really important,"" he says. ""But I want to solve this disease now.' In most labs around the world, drugs are screened against viruses using monkey cells, usually from the kidneys, he says. ""That's fine so long as we assume they're just like human respiratory cells. We didn't want to assume. We're using human respiratory cells straight away as well as some lung cells too [taken from] volunteers and then grown in the lab."" In the dish, he says the cells have little hairs. They beat and breathe. ""They're beautiful, living beasts. This is what the virus sees. So when we're testing on them we can already say it's more likely to get a similar result in a human. Of course in people it might be different again but we think we can get there [without] having to go into animal models. We are far, far closer."" Von Itzstein's team at Griffith University is testing how drugs can protect live human respiratory cells (above) from the virus. Once he and his team zero in on some likely contenders, von Itzstein has more in mind than just human trials. He wants to figure out how he could make the existing drugs being tested in hospitals even better at fighting COVID-19. His team use 3D modelling to map viruses and design ""plugs"" or molecules that can slot between the microbe and our cells to stop it replicating. If it can't get into cells to duplicate, it can't survive. ""Of course, we'll have to go through clinical trials again just in case the tweaks we've made create anything [harmful] but we'll already know a lot about the [existing] drug, how it works...we'll have a headstart."" Doherty says the work shows real promise. ""We might need something specifically designed for COVID-19."" Scientists have become first responders in the battle against the pandemic, putting in long hours in labs, including at The Walter Eliza Hall Institute's drug discovery lab.
Credit:WEHI Unlike the last pandemic, swine flu in 2009, this time the world is almost starting from scratch. Back then, a vaccine against the new influenza strain also had to be hastily pulled together but the virus was at least a somewhat familiar foe. The foundations for an inoculation were already laid from seasonal flu and there were two strong antiviral drugs that worked against it. One of them was Relenza, the world's first designer influenza drug, created by von Itzstein. “In 2009, the big difference was we had drugs that worked already in hospitals,” he says. ""We didn't see the diaster we see now."" No vaccine exists for a coronavirus, not even against the other two dangerous strains to emerge in the modern era, SARS and MERS. And, as both have struggled to attract research funding as caseloads fell, there are no proven drug therapies either. But scientists had been warning for years that another SARS-like coronavirus would emerge in humans thanks to ""spillovers"" from the animal world which are happening more and more as people encroach on habitats and poach wildlife. Doherty says that before COVID-19 burst onto the scene in December, the world had been taking some early steps towards preparing for its next pandemic, launching a rapid response vaccine program, CEPI, in 2017 for just such an event, with coronaviruses earmarked as priority. But in hindsight, he says there should have been a similar accelerator set up for reactive drug therapies too. ""It was something we've been missing that I mumbled about but I didn't shout about,"" Doherty says. ""We've done alright with the vaccines but we should have kept testing drugs [for] SARS, right across the coronaviruses, even others like Hendra virus. There's a lot of lessons here.""

""Treatments, but also something that prevents the infection, like the HIV PreP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] drugs you take twice a day, could get us out of this earlier."" Trials are now underway all around the world to find such a dual-action chemical. In some, healthcare workers are given a course of hydroxychloroquine over many weeks or months, at a lower dose than in trials testing the drug on infected patients. Scientists are making no promises – a chemical that can kill the virus in a test tube will not necessarily stop it replicating in a human throat, says Pellegrini, who is leading one such prevention trial in Melbourne for WEHI, which will be double-blinded. But, if they succeed, will we all take one tablet a day to keep coronavirus at bay? Not according to researchers. Such a prevention drug would likely only be given to those deemed high risk or already exposed, the way the antiviral Tamiflu is sometimes given to people in close contact with an influenza case. ""All drugs have side-effects, especially if given to a big population,"" Pellegrini says. ""So, especially now the virus is not spreading as widely here in the community, if we find something that works and that's safe, you'd still want to target it to mini-outbreaks or people at risk, say, in aged care homes or healthcare workers."" ""Multi-pronged attack"": Scientists screening less common drugs for COVID-19 potential at WEHI say they might not get there first but it's important to have a back-up plan if one drug fails.Credit:WEHI Then there's work underway into whether immunity could be temporarily ""borrowed"" from recovered patients via antibodies in their blood. Successfully fighting off a virus leaves us armed with these tiny warrior proteins in case it comes back, usually conferring at least a period of immunity (if not always a lifelong shield). The idea is you could perform a kind of transfusion from survivor to patient, spinning out the blood plasma with the antibodies inside. There are lingering questions about just how many antibodies our bodies produce against COVID-19 and how long they last. But hospitals in the US are already running trials of blood plasma donations from survivors for critically ill patients. Of course, if it works, there will be another hurdle to pass – supply. The current survivors, however generous, cannot donate enough blood plasma to inoculate the world. ""We could make antibodies specific for the virus, we do [that] all the time,"" Doherty adds. ""We grow them in enormous quantities in vats."" Creating our own custom antibodies against COVID-19 comes with its own lengthy testing – and takes us back into the realm of vaccine development. At the very least, survivors of the virus now carry in their veins crucial molecular clues for both inoculation and drug therapy. To find out which drugs will work best against a new pathogen, scientists have to first play detective. Professor Mark von Itzstein, who heads the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University, says designing a drug to kill off the virus directly means finding a good target for the attack – usually the protein that the virus uses to break into human cells and start making copies of itself. In this case, the much talked about spike protein. A number of drugs have since emerged that show promise against the virus and its spiky weapon – killing it off at least in test tubes. ""We've been screening a lot of those, and already getting some hits,"" von Itztein says. ""We've got some low-hanging fruit I'm desperate to evaluate immediately. If we can show drugs are not toxic at the doses needed to kill this virus [or] get prevention drugs up too to protect our first responders from infection, we could save lives.” A huge clinical trial led by the Doherty Institute has now been assembled across 70 hospitals in Australia and 11 in New Zealand, meaning most COVID-19 patients in the region will be able to opt in for an experimental treatment. Dubbed the ASCOT trial, it will test two drugs, at least to start with: hydroxychloroquine and the HIV therapy Kaletra. Both have been shown to stop the virus replicating in the lab and have been approved for ""compassionate use"" by doctors with nothing else in their toolkit in some parts of the world including the US. But these human trials have so far been fairly small-scale, yielding mixed results. At least 75 per cent of the trial participants will be given one of the drugs. Of those, a third will get a combination of the two, which researchers hope might improve the odds. Even before doctors began trying it out in COVID-19 wards – and US President Donald Trump told Americans to go out and take it – the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine had drawn interest early into the pandemic because it had been shown to kill the virus in test tubes, infectious disease clinician Steven Tong says. It comes with a good safety record against autoimmune diseases and is cheap and easily taken in tablet form. How it might stop a COVID-19 infection in animals or people is another story. Often what looks good under a microscope will fail or even make things worse in a human. The drug's side-effects can include heart problems, which is of particular concern, some experts say, because COVID-19 is known to attack the heart. One small trial of the drug on COVID-19 patients in France claimed to have a 100 per cent success rate but this was later disproved when serious problems with the research design emerged, including the fact one patient had died. Still, that didn't stop the hype. A larger study which has not yet been put through rigorous peer review has since suggested the drug does not reduce the risk of a COVID-19 patient deteriorating at all, and even hinted it might have exacerbated organ damage when given to a number of veterans hospitalised with the illness in the US. But, once again, experts have raised concerns about the study's design, including Professor Pellegrini who says the drug may have only been given to the sickest patients already in decline and so results should be interpreted with caution. Right now, hydroxychloroquine is available only with a prescription and should not be taken except under medical advice. A different form of the compound, which is not safe for humans, is sold as fish-tank cleaner. After Trump told people to try hydroxychloroquine (""What have you got to lose?"" he said), one man in Arizona took the fish cleaner, and died. Associate Professor Steven Tong is leading the trial from the Royal Melbourne Hospital and says the team will be keeping a close eye on other trials and lab studies around the world. Drugs showing promise can be added into the mix, pending supply. Nothing has been shown to work yet, all researchers stress – it's not time to rush out to a pharmacy or doctor. ASCOT had hoped to include another frontrunner, the intravenous drug Remdesivir, but was knocked back by the company that makes it, Gilead, due to supply issues. Gilead is rationing the drug for trials in countries with more patients, the Australian team says, but if more becomes available, it too might be tested here over the next 12-18 months. (Though a draft report from the WHO trial reportedly suggests it may not be the wonderdrug the world is hoping for). The ASCOT trial is designed to adapt as more information comes to hand - a drug performing well can be given to more patients while something reacting poorly or even causing harm can be dropped entirely. This antiviral didn't have much luck when it was deployed on the ground last year against an Ebola outbreak in the Congo and it's not yet widely used. But because it works by blocking a crucial protein that many viruses use to copy themselves, it's considered a broad antiviral – in the lab it also killed SARS and MERS, the other two dangerous coronaviruses to emerge in humans in the modern era. Against the virus that causes COVID-19, it also worked in both mice and cells in a dish. Some experts have theorised it will work best in the early stages of an infection but, because it has to be given to patients intravenously, it is unlikely to be deployed in mild cases. It is now being tested against COVID-19 overseas, including in China and the US, and is already widely approved for compassionate use by doctors - causing shortages of the drug that led its manufactuer to deny trials in both Australia and the UK access for testing. But on April 24, The Guardian reported the WHO had accidentally released a draft report into the first full trial of the drug early - and the document, which had not yet been peer-reviewed, showed it failed to help patients.  Back to the robots. As with many labs around the world, WEHI is now drawing on huge chemical databases to see if a drug that can fight COVID-19 might already on its books, even from the scrap heap of previous medical trials. ""Maybe there's a drug designed for a skin rash that didn't work on that but passed human trials,"" Pellegrini says. ""It might just kill COVID-19 or keep a cell alive against it."" To find this coveted compound, researchers are turning to artificial intelligence, machines that can run around the clock on a miniaturised scale not possible for humans, mixing different chemicals with viruses and cells, and using computer algorithms to decide which reactions look promising. The institute's new National Drug Discovery Centre is home to the largest screening effort in Australia. Pellegrini likens it to a factory assembling cars. “We can’t promise we’ll find a miracle drug, more likely it will help against the next pandemic,” he says. While the drug candidates already in trials had been quickly picked out from a screening of ""the usual suspects"", he stresses much is still not understood about the way COVID-19 operates. “So we need to cast our net wide too, and search as much as we can. We're throwing everything at it.” Another drug that has hit headlines after showing some virus-destroying power in test tubes is Ivermectin, commonly used to treat head lice and other parasites. It too already comes with a strong safety record as a prescribed medicine. But infectious disease clinician Steven Tong points out that the dose required to kill the new virus may be far too high to safely give to humans. The ASCOT trial is waiting on some extra lab studies before making a decision on whether to test it in patients. Fresh studies suggest the dose required to stop the virus may be up to 50 times the amount safe for humans.  Further north in Queensland, Professor von Itzstein is taking a different approach to fast-track screening. ""We're doing a broad look too, it may turn out to be really important,"" he says. ""But I want to solve this disease now.' In most labs around the world, drugs are screened against viruses using monkey cells, usually from the kidneys, he says. ""That's fine so long as we assume they're just like human respiratory cells. We didn't want to assume. We're using human respiratory cells straight away as well as some lung cells too [taken from] volunteers and then grown in the lab."" In the dish, he says the cells have little hairs. They beat and breathe. ""They're beautiful, living beasts. This is what the virus sees. So when we're testing on them we can already say it's more likely to get a similar result in a human. Of course in people it might be different again but we think we can get there [without] having to go into animal models. We are far, far closer."" Von Itzstein's team at Griffith University is testing how drugs can protect live human respiratory cells (above) from the virus. Once he and his team zero in on some likely contenders, von Itzstein has more in mind than just human trials. He wants to figure out how he could make the existing drugs being tested in hospitals even better at fighting COVID-19. His team use 3D modelling to map viruses and design ""plugs"" or molecules that can slot between the microbe and our cells to stop it replicating. If it can't get into cells to duplicate, it can't survive. ""Of course, we'll have to go through clinical trials again just in case the tweaks we've made create anything [harmful] but we'll already know a lot about the [existing] drug, how it works...we'll have a headstart."" Doherty says the work shows real promise. ""We might need something specifically designed for COVID-19."" Scientists have become first responders in the battle against the pandemic, putting in long hours in labs, including at The Walter Eliza Hall Institute's drug discovery lab.
Credit:WEHI Unlike the last pandemic, swine flu in 2009, this time the world is almost starting from scratch. Back then, a vaccine against the new influenza strain also had to be hastily pulled together but the virus was at least a somewhat familiar foe. The foundations for an inoculation were already laid from seasonal flu and there were two strong antiviral drugs that worked against it. One of them was Relenza, the world's first designer influenza drug, created by von Itzstein. “In 2009, the big difference was we had drugs that worked already in hospitals,” he says. ""We didn't see the diaster we see now."" No vaccine exists for a coronavirus, not even against the other two dangerous strains to emerge in the modern era, SARS and MERS. And, as both have struggled to attract research funding as caseloads fell, there are no proven drug therapies either. But scientists had been warning for years that another SARS-like coronavirus would emerge in humans thanks to ""spillovers"" from the animal world which are happening more and more as people encroach on habitats and poach wildlife. Doherty says that before COVID-19 burst onto the scene in December, the world had been taking some early steps towards preparing for its next pandemic, launching a rapid response vaccine program, CEPI, in 2017 for just such an event, with coronaviruses earmarked as priority. But in hindsight, he says there should have been a similar accelerator set up for reactive drug therapies too. ""It was something we've been missing that I mumbled about but I didn't shout about,"" Doherty says. ""We've done alright with the vaccines but we should have kept testing drugs [for] SARS, right across the coronaviruses, even others like Hendra virus. There's a lot of lessons here.""

Previous clinical trials using these two drugs to treat COVID-19 patients have produced mixed results.

9,/national/warning-light-coronavirus-can-last-longer-in-air-than-first-thought-20200420-p54li8.html,Coronavirus is not behaving in the air the way scientists expect,"The virus behind the world's COVID-19 pandemic can stay infectious in the air for more than 12 hours, early research out of four major US laboratories suggests, as more scientists warn it may have been underestimated by authorities such as the World Health Organisation. It is still unclear how much of the SARS-CoV-2 virus you would need to inhale to get sick. But researchers from America's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and elsewhere found it was ""remarkably resilient"" in the air when aerosolised into smaller particles compared with the two other deadly coronaviruses to emerge in humans, SARS and MERS. After 16 hours, particles of the new virus could still infect cells in a dish and looked intact under the microscope. Replay   ""That's very unusual, we'd expect them to be ripped apart in the air by then,"" said infectious disease aerobiologist Professor Chad Roy, one of the co-authors of the research. ""We scientists don't use this kind of bold language lightly so health authorities need to take note."" The work has not yet been put through rigorous peer review but was released this month ahead of publication as scientists around the world fast-track their usual, often protracted process in the face of a fast-moving and dangerous new virus. Professor Roy said the team was confident in the findings as they had been replicated across four different labs, including the US army's virology hub Fort Detrick. ""We're all running under a fire drill, there's still so much we don't know about this virus and it's all so urgent,"" he said. ""Of course we need more research, environmental conditions [outside the lab] will vary...and we haven't looked at personal susceptibility [or] dose...but in science when you see a warning light blinking on like this, you need to pay attention."" For doctors (and the general public) the term airborne calls to mind the film Outbreak and highly infectious diseases such as measles which can linger in the air for hours. Experts agree that is not the main way COVID-19 is spreading. If it were, some disease experts say the shape of the pandemic would likely look different – moving faster and infecting more people without a clear source. Instead, COVID-19 is thought to mostly spread through close contact, like the flu, in large water droplets, which can shoot out from the nose or mouth for up to a metre when a patient coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they contaminate surfaces but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. But the droplet theory, and the 1.5 metre distance rule adopted by most health authorities around the world, is based on old medical dogma from the 1930s, some aerosol experts such as WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska say. Researchers have since found that some respiratory illnesses, including the flu, can also travel in aerosols just from breathing or speaking. If the new virus can too, some say it might explain recent outbreaks such as on locked down cruise ships or the phenomenon of 'superspreaders"" also seen during SARS where one patient sheds much more virus than usual. While large particles tend to carry more virus than smaller aerosols, Professor Roy said it had been assumed by health authorities that only big droplets could carry any live virus at all. This work now added to a growing body of evidence the COVID-19 virus was also viable as an airborne pathogen, he said. ""I think as COVID-19 continues we will see its infection or [reproduction number] go up. It's certainly spreading easier than SARS."" But that still doesn't mean you'll catch it just from passing someone on the street. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. The World Health Organisation says there’s still not enough evidence the virus can spread by aerosol outside lab conditions or beyond hospitals where procedures such as intubation and ventilation are known to aerosolise it - and staff in COVID-19 wards already take airborne precautions. An Australian government spokeswoman said viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet but COVID-19 did not appear to spread in the air as efficiently as other diseases considered to be airborne. A greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces, she said. Of the new research, the government said such lab experiments were useful but at present physical distancing and hand hygiene had suppressed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Another study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found the life of the new virus in the air did not appear longer than that of the virus behind SARS, but both could last up there for a number of hours. Of COVID-19, the scientists concluded: ""aerosol transmission is plausible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to day"". Other early studies have returned mixed results - some found virus in the air of hospitals treating infected patients, some did not. One paper tracked a cluster of infections at a restaurant in China back to one asymptomatic patient - those who had caught the virus were found to be sitting in the direct flow of air pushed by the air conditioner, suggesting, according to the researchers, that droplets were the main route of transmission. Smear samples from the air conditioner failed to turn up active virus ""a finding less consistent with aerosol transmission"", they said. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier in April saying the current research supports the possibility that COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a small degree during SARS. And, in the wake of more evidence that people without symptoms are shedding the virus, the US has called on the community to wear cloth masks in close quarters such as supermarkets. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put frontline workers at risk. In a country like Australia, without rampant community transmission, most experts agree with the sentiment though some have called for greater focus on natural ventilation indoors alongside hand hygiene in light of emerging evidence on aerosols. An Australian government spokeswoman said air circulation systems such as heating and cooling were widely considered safe, though more data was needed.

10,/national/warning-light-coronavirus-can-last-longer-in-air-than-first-thought-20200420-p54li8.html,Coronavirus is not behaving in the air the way scientists expect,"The virus behind the world's COVID-19 pandemic can stay infectious in the air for more than 12 hours, early research out of four major US laboratories suggests, as more scientists warn it may have been underestimated by authorities such as the World Health Organisation. It is still unclear how much of the SARS-CoV-2 virus you would need to inhale to get sick. But researchers from America's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and elsewhere found it was ""remarkably resilient"" in the air when aerosolised into smaller particles compared with the two other deadly coronaviruses to emerge in humans, SARS and MERS. After 16 hours, particles of the new virus could still infect cells in a dish and looked intact under the microscope. Replay   ""That's very unusual, we'd expect them to be ripped apart in the air by then,"" said infectious disease aerobiologist Professor Chad Roy, one of the co-authors of the research. ""We scientists don't use this kind of bold language lightly so health authorities need to take note."" The work has not yet been put through rigorous peer review but was released this month ahead of publication as scientists around the world fast-track their usual, often protracted process in the face of a fast-moving and dangerous new virus. Professor Roy said the team was confident in the findings as they had been replicated across four different labs, including the US army's virology hub Fort Detrick. ""We're all running under a fire drill, there's still so much we don't know about this virus and it's all so urgent,"" he said. ""Of course we need more research, environmental conditions [outside the lab] will vary...and we haven't looked at personal susceptibility [or] dose...but in science when you see a warning light blinking on like this, you need to pay attention."" For doctors (and the general public) the term airborne calls to mind the film Outbreak and highly infectious diseases such as measles which can linger in the air for hours. Experts agree that is not the main way COVID-19 is spreading. If it were, some disease experts say the shape of the pandemic would likely look different – moving faster and infecting more people without a clear source.

The Royal Melbourne Hospital was averaging about 250 patients a day in its emergency room at the beginning of March, but now sees just 150 patients a day. The hospital's COVID-19 screening clinic was examining about 250 people each day in March and is now averaging about 50 people a day.

""There are people with chronic diseases, like diabetes, who we would expect to be seeing more of because those diseases are the ones that can get a little out of control."" Melbourne's major trauma hospital The Alfred has had a 50 per cent decline in patients to its emergency department, while The Austin recorded a 30 per cent drop. National figures are not yet available, but Westmead Hospital in Western Sydney also confirmed patient numbers were down. “Westmead Hospital emergency department is experiencing fewer presentations than normal, including less trauma and sport-related injuries,” emergency department nurse Donna Robertson said. “There has been a slight increase in injuries related to home repairs and home cooking.” Dr Putland said a significant reduction in patients with non-threatening medical conditions such as back pain and migraines was to be expected. So far, he had not been told of any critically ill patients who had died or put themselves at extreme risk by not seeking medical treatment, but he conceded it was difficult to measure. ""It can be really tricky to work out who's not showing up,"" he said.

15,/national/as-others-drove-up-prices-gavin-began-his-long-haul-ventilator-drive-20200419-p54l5p.html,"As others drove up prices, Gavin began his long-haul ventilator drive","It began with an urgent message. On March 22, an Australian charity desperately seeking ventilators to keep COVID-19 patients alive wrote to a NSW medical equipment supplier. Gavin Berry drove from Victoria to Queensland to the Illawarra to deliver ventilators.Credit:Chris Hopkins “Lives are at risk,” the charity told the supplier. Forty-eight hours earlier, the supplier had discussed selling six ventilators for $45,000 to the charity for donation to Australian hospitals. Now, the supplier was demanding $57,000 for the same six ventilators, telling the charity that overseas buyers were offering even more. As this NSW supplier was playing hardball with the charity Gavin Berry, owner of Victorian medical equipment supplier Biovet, was engaged in markedly different behaviour. Days before, as Australian hospitals raced to source ventilators, Mr Berry was contacted by the same charity. Mr Berry, who lives in the Victorian coastal town of Ocean Grove, told the charity he was willing to supply the Australian hospitals several ventilators at a fraction of their potential sale price. “Obviously I have elderly parents myself. Profit wasn’t important when you have the health of elderly people on the line,” he said. But there was a serious problem. The equipment Mr Berry was willing to sell at cost price was sitting 2000 kilometres away in central Queensland. So Mr Berry hopped into his truck and began driving. He would stop only to sleep and eat. The different responses of Mr Berry and the NSW supplier underline the challenge facing the Australian government as it races to secure vital equipment for hospitals, even as its coronavirus containment strategy appears to be working. As federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said on the weekend, while announcing the Coalition had secured tens of millions of face masks, the medical supply industry is still facing unparalleled demand for vital goods. Australia’s corporate registry shows that multiple companies have been created in the past few weeks to capitalise on demand, often doing no more than buying stock and raising the price for resale. Senior law enforcement sources have said police are struggling to meet community expectations about their ability to enforce new anti-profiteering laws but that the anticipated dampening of demand as the rate of the spread of the virus falls will be more effective than handcuffs and warrants. If the large-scale efforts of the government to secure supply have been undermined by some of the suppliers who have set up shop overnight, surety of supply has been aided by people like Mr Berry. He drove for six days and 4000 kilometres to deliver his ventilators for use in several hospitals, some of them in southern NSW. Professor Denis King from the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District said the ventilators had made “a huge difference to supporting our efforts in dealing with the challenging times ahead"". “Sourcing additional equipment that’s in short supply worldwide has been difficult for healthcare providers across the globe … [and to have] the manpower to help procure these goods has been an absolute blessing,” Professor King said. Mr Berry estimates he didn’t quite recoup his costs from selling his ventilators to the charity supplying hospitals and he refused an offer from the charity for more money. “I knew there could be patients who needed them, so I wanted to hurry,” he said, noting he was offered three times the price from an overseas buyer for the same equipment. The NSW supplier defends its harder-nosed approach to the same charity’s call for ventilators. Records show that it had advertised second-hand ventilators at $15,000 each when the firm was contacted by the charity on eBay on March 20. The charity said via eBay it was seeking ventilators at $9000 each but, after learning the NSW firm was offering an inferior second-hand model, the charity offered it $7500 per ventilator. The firm responded via text that it was “getting offers from overseas"". The charity responded by appealing to the firm’s altruism, stressing that it was “much better to have them [the ventilators] in the hospital system here.” Forty-eight hours later, the Sydney company replied with the bad news. “My partner is not happy about the price reduction to $7500. He has offers from overseas for much more than that,” the owner of the NSW business wrote to the charity buyer. Replay   Under pressure to deliver to hospitals, the charity relented and agreed to pay $9500 for each of the six second-hand ventilators. When asked by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald why his company had raised his overall price for his ventilators by $12,000 in less than two days, its owner was unrepentant. “I could have sold them for $20,000 [each],” he said. As of Sunday, 33 Australians with COVID-19 are on ventilators. Mr Berry takes quiet pride in knowing one of his machines could be helping keep people alive. “I probably lost a bit of money and did a hell of a lot of driving,” he says of his epic mission up the east coast of Australia to deliver on his promise to the charity. “But that’s the least I could do.” Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

Profit wasn’t important when you have the health of elderly people on the line,” he said. But there was a serious problem. The equipment Mr Berry was willing to sell at cost price was sitting 2000 kilometres away in central Queensland. So Mr Berry hopped into his truck and began driving. He would stop only to sleep and eat. The different responses of Mr Berry and the NSW supplier underline the challenge facing the Australian government as it races to secure vital equipment for hospitals, even as its coronavirus containment strategy appears to be working. As federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said on the weekend, while announcing the Coalition had secured tens of millions of face masks, the medical supply industry is still facing unparalleled demand for vital goods. Australia’s corporate registry shows that multiple companies have been created in the past few weeks to capitalise on demand, often doing no more than buying stock and raising the price for resale. Senior law enforcement sources have said police are struggling to meet community expectations about their ability to enforce new anti-profiteering laws but that the anticipated dampening of demand as the rate of the spread of the virus falls will be more effective than handcuffs and warrants. If the large-scale efforts of the government to secure supply have been undermined by some of the suppliers who have set up shop overnight, surety of supply has been aided by people like Mr Berry. He drove for six days and 4000 kilometres to deliver his ventilators for use in several hospitals, some of them in southern NSW. Professor Denis King from the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District said the ventilators had made “a huge difference to supporting our efforts in dealing with the challenging times ahead"". “Sourcing additional equipment that’s in short supply worldwide has been difficult for healthcare providers across the globe … [and to have] the manpower to help procure these goods has been an absolute blessing,” Professor King said. Mr Berry estimates he didn’t quite recoup his costs from selling his ventilators to the charity supplying hospitals and he refused an offer from the charity for more money. “I knew there could be patients who needed them, so I wanted to hurry,” he said, noting he was offered three times the price from an overseas buyer for the same equipment. The NSW supplier defends its harder-nosed approach to the same charity’s call for ventilators. Records show that it had advertised second-hand ventilators at $15,000 each when the firm was contacted by the charity on eBay on March 20. The charity said via eBay it was seeking ventilators at $9000 each but, after learning the NSW firm was offering an inferior second-hand model, the charity offered it $7500 per ventilator. The firm responded via text that it was “getting offers from overseas"". The charity responded by appealing to the firm’s altruism, stressing that it was “much better to have them [the ventilators] in the hospital system here.” Forty-eight hours later, the Sydney company replied with the bad news. “My partner is not happy about the price reduction to $7500. He has offers from overseas for much more than that,” the owner of the NSW business wrote to the charity buyer. Replay   Under pressure to deliver to hospitals, the charity relented and agreed to pay $9500 for each of the six second-hand ventilators. When asked by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald why his company had raised his overall price for his ventilators by $12,000 in less than two days, its owner was unrepentant. “I could have sold them for $20,000 [each],” he said. As of Sunday, 33 Australians with COVID-19 are on ventilators. Mr Berry takes quiet pride in knowing one of his machines could be helping keep people alive. “I probably lost a bit of money and did a hell of a lot of driving,” he says of his epic mission up the east coast of Australia to deliver on his promise to the charity. “But that’s the least I could do.” Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

Townsville man Matthew Anthony Russo was found by a housemate on the morning of January 6, 2015, making ""gurgling"" or ""mumbling"" sounds, with blood coming from his mouth. The focus of the inquest was whether adequate care had been given in the first instance by the GPs. Credit:AFP He died shortly after, within 18 hours of his last visit to a doctor. Closing the coronial inquest last week, Northern Coroner Nerida Wilson found Mr Russo's cause of death to be heart failure, brought about by sepsis stemming from undiagnosed pneumonia. Mr Russo had previously taken complaints of flu-like symptoms and a cough to both general practitioners, from different medical practices in the city, within three days of each other. The focus of the inquest, held over four days last year, was whether adequate care had been given in the first instance by the GPs. Ten witnesses were called, including Mr Russo's mother, his housemates, the two doctors, an investigating police officer and experts in the field of respiratory medicine. The doctors, Edel Garcia Monteagudo and Seyedfakhroddin Sajadi, both gave evidence they had made observations and taken vital signs during the visits, though neither recorded these - which they said had been their practice if these were within a normal range. In his notes from Mr Russo's visit, Dr Monteagudo recorded some ""crackles"" in the man's lower left lung and would later recall for the inquest a ""streaking of blood in the sputum"". Ms Wilson heard that Dr Monteagudo did not inform himself, and was not informed by Mr Russo, of his visit to Dr Sajadi just three days prior. Mr Russo, who was 37 at the time, was a known smoker and had a body mass index that classified him as obese. He had also been exposed to methylamphetamine up to three days before his death - though the extent and frequency of this use is unknown. ""These risk factors negated the advantage of Mr Russo’s relative youth,"" the coroner said. ""Although even that is arguable when lower lung crackles and blood streaked sputum are present."" Overall, the medical treatment received from Dr Sajadi was ""reasonable"" given the lack of symptoms in his lower lungs, she found. Though the failure to record Mr Russo’s vital signs did ""not meet minimum standards required of a general practitioner"". ""Dr Sajadi has since undertaken professional development in the area medical record keeping,"" she said. Ms Wilson found Dr Monteagudo had misdiagnosed Mr Russo with bronchitis, did not provide a reasonable explanation for crackles in his lung and ""did not positively exclude pneumonia"". ""I find that the medical treatment Mr Russo received from Dr Monteagudo was not adequate or appropriate,"" she said. ""I have not gone so far as to suggest or find that Mr Russo’s death could have been prevented. ""It is impossible to know whether Mr Russo would have responded to treatment even if he had presented to a tertiary hospital emergency department, noting the aggressive progression of his life-threatening sepsis.""

19,/national/how-conspiracy-theories-about-covid-19-went-viral-20200318-p54bhm.html,How conspiracy theories about COVID-19 went viral,"As conspiracy theories go, the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic offered all the right ingredients. Scientists think the virus jumped from wild animals into humans, likely in late 2019 in the bustling Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan, central China. But it just so happens that a half-hour drive from that market, across the Yangtze River, is China’s highest-security biosafety laboratory. At the Wuhan Institute of Virology, hazard suits are de rigueur for scientists studying some of the world’s most dangerous diseases. Within days of news that a new deadly coronavirus had been identified in humans, unfounded claims that it was really a bioweapon or escaped experiment from this Wuhan lab were spreading nearly as fast as the virus itself. Now the world is in the grip of its next pandemic, this time in the golden age of social media, and conspiracy theorists are in their element. But why do pandemics breed conspiracy theories? What are scientists saying? And is there any right way to argue with a conspiracy theorist? Scientists at the epidemiological laboratory in Wuhan's Institute of Virology. Credit:AFP Some theories claim that COVID-19 is a population-control scheme or a top-secret spy operation gone wrong. Others question whether it exists at all or point to similar (but unrelated) patents for coronavirus vaccines as a sign it's all a cash grab by big pharmaceutical companies. More than one breathless Youtuber has blamed Wuhan’s recent rollout of 5G Wi-Fi. Politicians from the US, Iran, South America and even China have ignored the findings of their own scientists and seized on fringe theories to weaponise the crisis against their rivals. Kremlin-friendly sites and Chinese blogs hiss COVID-19 was cooked up by the CIA. The Trump White House, meanwhile, floats the theory that it's really a plot to bring down the US President. This story of a virus built in a lab is one of the most popular out there, but perhaps the most easily debunked. The new strain's genome has now been studied by thousands of scientists around the world. They've already found a close match in a bat virus discovered in 2013, and say this new strain can only have evolved in nature – it's too good to be a cut-and-paste job, and it would make a pretty poor weapon because it is highly contagious (and so uncontrollable) but not as deadly as other pathogens. They don’t know exactly when or how it made the jump from animals into humans. But many of those first cases have been traced back to the Wuhan seafood market, where vendors were known to sell wildlife and investigators found environmental samples of the virus. Such wet markets are notorious breeding grounds for disease as stressed animals from all corners of the world are caged close together, trading unfamiliar diseases, and then handled and butchered by humans. It happened that way with SARS, the first deadly coronavirus outbreak of the modern era, and then again with the second, MERS, this time along camel trade routes and slaughterhouses in the Middle East. So why does the bioweapon rumour persist? Some of the trouble started with a draft paper, which was not peer reviewed, claiming to find traces of HIV artificially inserted into the new virus's genetic code. The work was quickly withdrawn by its authors after it was debunked for using incorrect data but not before it was seized upon by blogs and right-wing pundits as ""proof"" of manipulation, eventually finding its way into a US senator's talking points and Fox News bulletins. President Donald Trump says his administration is now looking into the Wuhan lab as a possible source for the outbreak but General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on April 15 that US intelligence indicates the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, rather than in a lab, although he noted there was no certainty yet either way. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of President Trump’s pandemic task force, also rejected suggestions from the White House that the virus was man-made. “The mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human,"" he said. An image of a bamboo rat caged on top of a deer allegedly sold at the Wuhan seafood market has circulated online. Credit:Weibo Back at that lab in Wuhan, scientists were on the frontline of the outbreak in a sense – theirs was the only facility in China able to safely handle the new pathogen. The institute is an offshoot of the state-owned Chinese Academy of the Sciences, and part of co-operative project with France, but it wasn’t built for the development of ""biological warfare"", as has been reported in some corners of the media, and virologists say it's far from top-secret – international collaboration is common. Forced to issue a statement denying rumours a student from the lab was the so-called Patient X, or first case, researchers said they had been ""racing against time"", many of them recalled early from their holidays, to help identify and tackle the virus. Still, suspicion lingered – viral leaks from labs are not without precedent and the centre had been studying coronaviruses, as are many such institutes around the world. In fact, one of the team, China’s ""bat woman"", respected virologist Shi Zhengli, had been warning another SARS-like coronavirus would jump from bats into humans sooner or later. When the call did come, one evening in early December, she reportedly checked all the lab's samples, just in case something had been mishandled. It hadn’t, she said. This virus was new but analysis found the strain was also 96 per cent similar to one that Shi herself had already identified seven years earlier, in a bat down in China’s south. That work cataloguing wild viruses may have now given the world a headstart on ending this pandemic. Still accusations against the lab continue to cause headaches for its team – a known US conspiracy theorist and lawyer has even filed a multi-trillion-dollar lawsuit against Shi, the institute and the Chinese government over the release of a ""bioweapon"". After a number of the researchers were targeted online and their personal details released, Shi herself was forced to make a statement swearing on her life the virus had not come from the lab. On April 19, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia shared some of the United States' concerns about the World Health Organisation's handling of the pandemic – it has been accused by the White House of bowing to political and financial influence from China – and an independent global inquiry needed to “get to the bottom” of COVID-19. ""We need to know the sorts of details that an independent review would identify for us about the genesis of the virus, about the approaches to dealing with it, and addressing the openness with which information was shared,” Senator Payne said. France, which helped set up the Wuhan lab, said where was ""no factual evidence corroborating the information recently circulating in the United States press that establishes a link between the origins of COVID-19 and the work of the P4 laboratory of Wuhan, China."" The lab also responded yet again to the theories. ""There's no way this virus came out from us,"" said the president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan Branch, Yuan Zhiming, in an interview with state television in China. ""We clearly know what kind of virus research is going on in the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples."" He reiterated there was not no evidence of the virus having artificial or synthetic traces. He understood why people had jumped to conclusions about his institute in Wuhan, given the pandemic originated there, but it was a ""malicious move to purposefully mislead the people"". ""I know it's impossible. This is entirely based on speculation."" Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton has also called for transparency from China about the origins of the virus, saying the families of those who have died so far deserve answers. ""What we don't want is theories that don't have any basis spreading out there – we've seen a lot of that on social media – what we want is the facts,"" he said on April 17. ""It would certainly be demanded of us if Australia was at the epicentre of this virus."" He then added: ""We know this is not the first instance of a virus being spread from the wildlife wet markets and we need to be honest about that."" Australia has questioned China's decision to reopen wet markets, as it did after SARS, a move Prime Minister Scott Morrison called ""unfathomable"" given what is known about their health risks.  – with Eryk Bagshaw and Deutsche Press Agenteur GmbH But is it really so crazy to believe a story like that? Colin Klein, an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the Australian National University, says when ""things are changing rapidly [and] it’s not actually unreasonable to [assume] some people have more information than others"". Conspiracy theories are born out of the murky feeling that not all is being revealed to us, that the truth is still in shadow, and someone else is pulling the strings. During a fast-moving pandemic, where news breaks faster than scientists can make reliable findings, false credibility can attach to seemingly plausible explanations. In this case, real crackdowns by Chinese police on doctors who raised the alarm about early cases of the mystery illness did not help,  along with China’s record of covering up the extent of the SARS outbreak in 2002. This time around, US intelligence says history may be repeating itself, as it queries both the nation’s total reported cases and deaths from COVID-19. Klein specialises in the philosophy of neuroscience, and a research project on misinformation has meant he's spent a lot of time on internet conspiracy theory forums where, for months already, there have been ""quite a variety of COVID-19-related stuff"". ""Nobody has the full story yet,"" he says. ""Government and news outlets [haven’t] been super-reassuring – it may just be because there’s no reassurance to be had."" But it's not the first time the high-anxiety narrative of an outbreak has sent imaginations running wild. When the infamous 1918 Spanish flu finished its lethal sweep across the world at the end of World War I, it had claimed more lives than the war itself. And in the absence of a known source, stories quickly spread that the Germans had developed the virus as a new kind of weapon. Nearly 100 years later, Ebola was also wrongly called a biological weapon when it began its major rampage across Africa in 2014; and the Zika crisis of 2015 was blamed on everything from vaccinations to genetically engineered mosquitoes. A recent paper found that attempts to debunk these false Zika theories in Brazil at the time were wildly unsuccessful – if anything they just left people feeling less certain about all information coming to them, even from official channels. But when yellow fever emerged in the same region just a few years later, efforts to counter the same inevitable deluge of misinformation had more impact – suggesting that conspiracies are harder to combat when a disease is new with less reliable information about it. The current Wuhan bioweapon conspiracy theory echoes the famous Cold War-era Operation Infektion when the KGB spread the lie that HIV was created in a US biological weapons laboratory at Fort Detrick in the US state of Maryland – right near where, coincidentally, Klein himself grew up. All these diseases actually came from animals – as 70 per cent of all new pathogens emerging in humans do. As people push further and further into the world’s last wild places, such ""spillovers"" are happening more and more. The solution, experts say, is getting ahead of them, monitoring viruses circulating in likely carrier species such as bats and rethinking our riskier interactions with wildlife (including caging them for meat and parts or forcing them into populated areas by clearing forests). But conspiracy theories distract from this; often, they become a smokescreen themselves. US disease ecologist Dr Jon Epstein has been working with scientists such as Shi for the past 15 years to monitor animal viruses – together they even traced the original SARS strain back to a colony of bats. The ""scientific evidence is overwhelming"" that COVID-19 came from bats, too, he says. ""And we’ve been warning about it for a long time."" As the science crystallises, conspiracy theories will sink to the bottom of the conversation again. It’s already starting, Epstein says. But in the meantime, in the realm of public health, they can do real damage. Women in Australia during the Spanish flu epidemic. Rumours spread that the virus was a German weapon.Credit:National Museum of Australia Pandemics are frightening, fluid beasts and that makes them ripe for misinformation, warns Jessica Brandt, head of policy at the Alliance for Securing Democracy in Washington, DC. ""This time, the response has unfortunately become politicised,"" she says. Both China and the US have come under fire for wasting crucial time in responding to the outbreak. And they've also attracted most of the blame in biological weapon theories circulating online. But officials in both countries have spread plenty of their own conspiratorial notions too, trading blows in the war of messaging as the pandemic picks up steam. In the US, some conservatives have sought to recast the crisis as one of Chinese military aggression rather than a failure by China's government to contain the outbreak. President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and even US Senator Tom Cotton pointed to the Wuhan lab as its origin. And in recent days the president himself and his officials have begun flirting with the theory too, offering no further evidence but demanding answers from China. “More and more, we’re hearing the story,” Trump told reporters in Washington. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added: “The mere fact that we don’t know the answers – that China hasn’t shared the answers – I think is very, very telling.” Meanwhile, Chinese officials have been conjuring up the same theories, only with their own anti-Western twist. While the government had at first blamed the outbreak on the ""illegal wildlife trade"", by March Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao was tweeting articles from a known conspiracy theory site linking COVID-19 to Fort Detrick’s biowarfare program and even a recent US army stopover in Wuhan. Add to this loud efforts by Iran (and more stealthy online campaigns from Russian bots and pro-Kremlin media sites) to further sow doubt about the natural origins of the virus. Klein notes that conspiracy theories tend to track political interests, with COVID-19 being connected to a variety of agendas: ""It’s being done to undermine Trump; [it] is being done to put in an authoritarian state; or get us ready for all having to be locked in our homes; or it’s being done to kill off the poor."" In Washington DC, information warfare expert Molly McKew says there is certainly a political divide in conspiracy narratives right now, but distrust in institutions fuels common theories for everyone. ""Ideas about martial law and a massive expansion in government power make Americans of both sides of the political spectrum nervous,"" she says. ""People are quick to share rumours about emergency powers and expanded surveillance, some of it real or some of it not."" In the US, for example, as cities go into lockdown to stem the spread of COVID-19, people are not panic-buying just groceries but guns. Kurt Russell in the 1982 movie The Thing, which conjured a sense of obscure danger – as pandemics also do.Credit:Alamy To some extent, the same thing that makes a good Hollywood thriller, says Klein. First, there's the basic structure, the classic dramatic arc with a beginning, conflict and perhaps even a resolution – unlike the more messy and incomplete tale of COVID-19. ""Somebody eats a bat and they get kind of sick and nobody notices for a while and then everybody gets kind of sick is not a very satisfying story,"" says Klein. ""If you were to take that to your short-story writing class, people would say: 'That’s a terrible story. Come back later'."" Then there is mood. There's a very real sense of ""obscure danger"" to COVID-19 as it unfolds, and that plays straight into a more elaborate narrative. ""You don’t know where it came from, who has it or who doesn’t – where it might come from next,"" Klein says. ""It could be anybody, it could be the person next to you on the bus. That’s a good device for building dramatic tension, right? [Like the] great old movie The Thing with Kurt Russell, with a shape-shifting alien – that’s a great set-up and I think pandemics have a similar feeling to them."" Where does the toilet paper hoarding fit in, though? ""It’s weird that people go for this,"" says Klein. ""But pandemics touch on this feeling of vulnerability about your body and your health and people’s panic reaction is not to buy a bunch of quinoa, it’s to buy toilet paper – to buy things that are about cleanliness and purity to ward off the disease. In general, feelings about purity and cleanliness make for good stories, [they] can be emotionally powerful."" Some people have a conspiracy mindset. Perhaps they distrust institutions or feel disempowered by the status quo. They can be someone sharing a meme on Facebook all the way through to what Klein describes as those with ""lots of things on [the] wall with yarn going between them"", making connections where they want to find them. But more commonly, people harbour conspiracy beliefs on topics that push their buttons. ""Someone has a bad experience with the police, maybe that primes them [to believe in police cover-ups],"" Klein says. ""It’s not outlandish in the US to think that the police killed somebody and covered it up, because that actually happens. It’s probably wrong – but it’s not crazy."" There's no doubt cyberspace is fertile ground for conspiracy theories – as with the theories themselves, everything on the web is connected. Social media algorithms favour content that generates high emotional responses in people over rational or verified sites. With no fact-checkers built into platforms, a seductive conspiracy theory has little barrier from spreading: all it needs is people to react. But these theories don't only crop up online, they can surface in popular music, around the dinner table, even in mainstream media. And they didn't begin with the internet age – the US alone has a long history of conspiratorial thinking. False accusations that the British were secretly planning to enslave the American colonists even helped spark revolution in 1775. In a famous 1964 essay on The Paranoid Style in American Thinking, historian Richard Hofstadter describes conspiratorial types ""always manning the barricades of civilisation"". But it is ""the use of paranoid modes of expression by more or less normal people that makes the phenomenon significant,"" he says. There’s little point, says Klein, given the self-reinforcing nature of the theories themselves. ""I could say, ‘it’s wrong’, but that just shows I’m part of the conspiracy, too: Professor Obviously in League With the Government Helping Them Cover It Up."" In a similar vein, Facebook or YouTube removing conspiratorial misinformation can serve to make people feel like something is being suppressed. Why people continue to believe such stories in spite of scientific rebuttal reflects the reality of our information environment today, says Brandt. ""Lies travel faster than facts and, perversely, efforts to debunk a conspiracy theory can end up reinforcing it."" But some say the new ability for such theories to catch on in the mainstream through the fast, supercharged medium of the internet means they can’t just be ignored either. While banning a shock jock such as the American Alex Jones for peddling falsehoods online might make him a martyr to his devoted followers, it could also stop him reaching new audiences. And some studies suggest dismantling theories with logic can actually work – especially when the person pointing out the holes in the story is perceived to be smart and competent. Increasingly, authorities treat such misinformation contagion like their biological equivalent – proactively pushing out the right facts to inoculate people against unfounded theories or encouraging good information hygiene (such as checking sources). Even before COVID-19 had exploded into a pandemic, the World Health Organisation had teamed up with the likes of Google and Facebook to try to reach audiences with its own set of facts before conspiracy theorists could. These days, Klein says he considers such theories more as symptoms of a bigger problem, whether it be lack of transparency or a failure of communication. ""I think just trying to tackle ... conspiracy theories on their own doesn’t do much compared to trying to figure out why people believe these things and what you can do to stop that broader problem,"" he says. For most people, the more consistent and clear the messaging is from the people higher up, the better – even if that information is ""we don't know yet"". ""But there’s a sense in which trying to engage with full-bore conspiracy theorists just, at best, sucks you deeper into what they believe,"" Klein says. ""Once you fully get in, it’s very hard to get out."" The Capture (ABC iView) A British soldier is found not guilty of a crime in Afghanistan only to become the suspect in his barrister’s kidnapping in London. The incriminating evidence in both “crimes” is video footage. But is it real? The deployment of modern surveillance technologies to ping hapless citizens comes under the microscope as a London detective uncovers a web of conspiracies that, naturally, cross continents and go right to the top. Secret City (Netflix) Lake Burley Griffin takes on a sinister edge in this thriller set in our national capital, based on the book by journalists Steve Lewis and Chris Uhlmann. Jackie Weaver plays the attorney-general and minister for home affairs with mesmerising charm – ""Better get your raincoat, Mal, 'cos you've unleashed a s--storm of biblical proportions"" – while Anna Torv plays a political journalist seeking truth and transparency, despite threats to her life and career. Devs (Foxtel)  After her computer programmer boyfriend vanishes, a young woman is drawn into the smoke and mirrors world of the “Devs” division of a quantum computing company – which is developing a mysterious predictive algorithm that challenges the notion of free will. Cue spies wrestling in underground car parks, bright young things brainstorming humanity-altering code and a sense of creeping dread among the Californian redwoods.     Conspiracy (Netflix) A veritable smorgasbord of classic conspiracy theories – the Apollo 11 Moon landing was faked, Hitler lived beyond World War II, and so on – explored in 12 episodes. Sure, there are cameo appearances from Lord Lucan and Jimmy Hoffa but not everyone is a usual suspect – was martial arts star Bruce Lee murdered? – and provocations include ""Do governments sometimes sacrifice their own people for political gain?"" Surely not.  Contagion (Amazon Prime) ""In order to get scared, all you have to do is come into contact with a rumour,""  is a public health official's retort to a conspiracy theorist in this 2011 pandemic blockbuster that's been name-checked an awful lot lately. The conspiracy theorist, played by Jude Law, weaves an apparently compelling story on his blog and on TV – something about Big Pharma and a natural cure that is, of course, being covered up by the powers that be.   If you'd like some expert background on an issue or a news event, drop us a line at explainers@smh.com.au or explainers@theage.com.au.

Scientists think the virus jumped from wild animals into humans, likely in late 2019 in the bustling Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan, central China. But it just so happens that a half-hour drive from that market, across the Yangtze River, is China’s highest-security biosafety laboratory. At the Wuhan Institute of Virology, hazard suits are de rigueur for scientists studying some of the world’s most dangerous diseases. Within days of news that a new deadly coronavirus had been identified in humans, unfounded claims that it was really a bioweapon or escaped experiment from this Wuhan lab were spreading nearly as fast as the virus itself. Now the world is in the grip of its next pandemic, this time in the golden age of social media, and conspiracy theorists are in their element. But why do pandemics breed conspiracy theories? What are scientists saying? And is there any right way to argue with a conspiracy theorist? Scientists at the epidemiological laboratory in Wuhan's Institute of Virology. Credit:AFP Some theories claim that COVID-19 is a population-control scheme or a top-secret spy operation gone wrong. Others question whether it exists at all or point to similar (but unrelated) patents for coronavirus vaccines as a sign it's all a cash grab by big pharmaceutical companies. More than one breathless Youtuber has blamed Wuhan’s recent rollout of 5G Wi-Fi. Politicians from the US, Iran, South America and even China have ignored the findings of their own scientists and seized on fringe theories to weaponise the crisis against their rivals. Kremlin-friendly sites and Chinese blogs hiss COVID-19 was cooked up by the CIA. The Trump White House, meanwhile, floats the theory that it's really a plot to bring down the US President. This story of a virus built in a lab is one of the most popular out there, but perhaps the most easily debunked. The new strain's genome has now been studied by thousands of scientists around the world. They've already found a close match in a bat virus discovered in 2013, and say this new strain can only have evolved in nature – it's too good to be a cut-and-paste job, and it would make a pretty poor weapon because it is highly contagious (and so uncontrollable) but not as deadly as other pathogens. They don’t know exactly when or how it made the jump from animals into humans. But many of those first cases have been traced back to the Wuhan seafood market, where vendors were known to sell wildlife and investigators found environmental samples of the virus. Such wet markets are notorious breeding grounds for disease as stressed animals from all corners of the world are caged close together, trading unfamiliar diseases, and then handled and butchered by humans. It happened that way with SARS, the first deadly coronavirus outbreak of the modern era, and then again with the second, MERS, this time along camel trade routes and slaughterhouses in the Middle East. So why does the bioweapon rumour persist? Some of the trouble started with a draft paper, which was not peer reviewed, claiming to find traces of HIV artificially inserted into the new virus's genetic code. The work was quickly withdrawn by its authors after it was debunked for using incorrect data but not before it was seized upon by blogs and right-wing pundits as ""proof"" of manipulation, eventually finding its way into a US senator's talking points and Fox News bulletins. President Donald Trump says his administration is now looking into the Wuhan lab as a possible source for the outbreak but General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on April 15 that US intelligence indicates the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, rather than in a lab, although he noted there was no certainty yet either way. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of President Trump’s pandemic task force, also rejected suggestions from the White House that the virus was man-made. “The mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human,"" he said.

Credit:Weibo Back at that lab in Wuhan, scientists were on the frontline of the outbreak in a sense – theirs was the only facility in China able to safely handle the new pathogen. The institute is an offshoot of the state-owned Chinese Academy of the Sciences, and part of co-operative project with France, but it wasn’t built for the development of ""biological warfare"", as has been reported in some corners of the media, and virologists say it's far from top-secret – international collaboration is common. Forced to issue a statement denying rumours a student from the lab was the so-called Patient X, or first case, researchers said they had been ""racing against time"", many of them recalled early from their holidays, to help identify and tackle the virus. Still, suspicion lingered – viral leaks from labs are not without precedent and the centre had been studying coronaviruses, as are many such institutes around the world. In fact, one of the team, China’s ""bat woman"", respected virologist Shi Zhengli, had been warning another SARS-like coronavirus would jump from bats into humans sooner or later. When the call did come, one evening in early December, she reportedly checked all the lab's samples, just in case something had been mishandled. It hadn’t, she said. This virus was new but analysis found the strain was also 96 per cent similar to one that Shi herself had already identified seven years earlier, in a bat down in China’s south. That work cataloguing wild viruses may have now given the world a headstart on ending this pandemic. Still accusations against the lab continue to cause headaches for its team – a known US conspiracy theorist and lawyer has even filed a multi-trillion-dollar lawsuit against Shi, the institute and the Chinese government over the release of a ""bioweapon"". After a number of the researchers were targeted online and their personal details released, Shi herself was forced to make a statement swearing on her life the virus had not come from the lab. On April 19, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia shared some of the United States' concerns about the World Health Organisation's handling of the pandemic – it has been accused by the White House of bowing to political and financial influence from China – and an independent global inquiry needed to “get to the bottom” of COVID-19. ""We need to know the sorts of details that an independent review would identify for us about the genesis of the virus, about the approaches to dealing with it, and addressing the openness with which information was shared,” Senator Payne said. France, which helped set up the Wuhan lab, said where was ""no factual evidence corroborating the information recently circulating in the United States press that establishes a link between the origins of COVID-19 and the work of the P4 laboratory of Wuhan, China."" The lab also responded yet again to the theories. ""There's no way this virus came out from us,"" said the president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan Branch, Yuan Zhiming, in an interview with state television in China. ""We clearly know what kind of virus research is going on in the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples."" He reiterated there was not no evidence of the virus having artificial or synthetic traces. He understood why people had jumped to conclusions about his institute in Wuhan, given the pandemic originated there, but it was a ""malicious move to purposefully mislead the people"". ""I know it's impossible. This is entirely based on speculation."" Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton has also called for transparency from China about the origins of the virus, saying the families of those who have died so far deserve answers. ""What we don't want is theories that don't have any basis spreading out there – we've seen a lot of that on social media – what we want is the facts,"" he said on April 17. ""It would certainly be demanded of us if Australia was at the epicentre of this virus."" He then added: ""We know this is not the first instance of a virus being spread from the wildlife wet markets and we need to be honest about that."" Australia has questioned China's decision to reopen wet markets, as it did after SARS, a move Prime Minister Scott Morrison called ""unfathomable"" given what is known about their health risks.  – with Eryk Bagshaw and Deutsche Press Agenteur GmbH But is it really so crazy to believe a story like that? Colin Klein, an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the Australian National University, says when ""things are changing rapidly [and] it’s not actually unreasonable to [assume] some people have more information than others"". Conspiracy theories are born out of the murky feeling that not all is being revealed to us, that the truth is still in shadow, and someone else is pulling the strings. During a fast-moving pandemic, where news breaks faster than scientists can make reliable findings, false credibility can attach to seemingly plausible explanations. In this case, real crackdowns by Chinese police on doctors who raised the alarm about early cases of the mystery illness did not help,  along with China’s record of covering up the extent of the SARS outbreak in 2002. This time around, US intelligence says history may be repeating itself, as it queries both the nation’s total reported cases and deaths from COVID-19. Klein specialises in the philosophy of neuroscience, and a research project on misinformation has meant he's spent a lot of time on internet conspiracy theory forums where, for months already, there have been ""quite a variety of COVID-19-related stuff"". ""Nobody has the full story yet,"" he says. ""Government and news outlets [haven’t] been super-reassuring – it may just be because there’s no reassurance to be had."" But it's not the first time the high-anxiety narrative of an outbreak has sent imaginations running wild. When the infamous 1918 Spanish flu finished its lethal sweep across the world at the end of World War I, it had claimed more lives than the war itself. And in the absence of a known source, stories quickly spread that the Germans had developed the virus as a new kind of weapon. Nearly 100 years later, Ebola was also wrongly called a biological weapon when it began its major rampage across Africa in 2014; and the Zika crisis of 2015 was blamed on everything from vaccinations to genetically engineered mosquitoes. A recent paper found that attempts to debunk these false Zika theories in Brazil at the time were wildly unsuccessful – if anything they just left people feeling less certain about all information coming to them, even from official channels. But when yellow fever emerged in the same region just a few years later, efforts to counter the same inevitable deluge of misinformation had more impact – suggesting that conspiracies are harder to combat when a disease is new with less reliable information about it. The current Wuhan bioweapon conspiracy theory echoes the famous Cold War-era Operation Infektion when the KGB spread the lie that HIV was created in a US biological weapons laboratory at Fort Detrick in the US state of Maryland – right near where, coincidentally, Klein himself grew up. All these diseases actually came from animals – as 70 per cent of all new pathogens emerging in humans do. As people push further and further into the world’s last wild places, such ""spillovers"" are happening more and more. The solution, experts say, is getting ahead of them, monitoring viruses circulating in likely carrier species such as bats and rethinking our riskier interactions with wildlife (including caging them for meat and parts or forcing them into populated areas by clearing forests). But conspiracy theories distract from this; often, they become a smokescreen themselves. US disease ecologist Dr Jon Epstein has been working with scientists such as Shi for the past 15 years to monitor animal viruses – together they even traced the original SARS strain back to a colony of bats. The ""scientific evidence is overwhelming"" that COVID-19 came from bats, too, he says. ""And we’ve been warning about it for a long time."" As the science crystallises, conspiracy theories will sink to the bottom of the conversation again. It’s already starting, Epstein says. But in the meantime, in the realm of public health, they can do real damage. Women in Australia during the Spanish flu epidemic.

""This time, the response has unfortunately become politicised,"" she says. Both China and the US have come under fire for wasting crucial time in responding to the outbreak. And they've also attracted most of the blame in biological weapon theories circulating online. But officials in both countries have spread plenty of their own conspiratorial notions too, trading blows in the war of messaging as the pandemic picks up steam. In the US, some conservatives have sought to recast the crisis as one of Chinese military aggression rather than a failure by China's government to contain the outbreak. President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and even US Senator Tom Cotton pointed to the Wuhan lab as its origin. And in recent days the president himself and his officials have begun flirting with the theory too, offering no further evidence but demanding answers from China. “More and more, we’re hearing the story,” Trump told reporters in Washington. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added: “The mere fact that we don’t know the answers – that China hasn’t shared the answers – I think is very, very telling.” Meanwhile, Chinese officials have been conjuring up the same theories, only with their own anti-Western twist. While the government had at first blamed the outbreak on the ""illegal wildlife trade"", by March Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao was tweeting articles from a known conspiracy theory site linking COVID-19 to Fort Detrick’s biowarfare program and even a recent US army stopover in Wuhan. Add to this loud efforts by Iran (and more stealthy online campaigns from Russian bots and pro-Kremlin media sites) to further sow doubt about the natural origins of the virus. Klein notes that conspiracy theories tend to track political interests, with COVID-19 being connected to a variety of agendas: ""It’s being done to undermine Trump; [it] is being done to put in an authoritarian state; or get us ready for all having to be locked in our homes; or it’s being done to kill off the poor."" In Washington DC, information warfare expert Molly McKew says there is certainly a political divide in conspiracy narratives right now, but distrust in institutions fuels common theories for everyone. ""Ideas about martial law and a massive expansion in government power make Americans of both sides of the political spectrum nervous,"" she says. ""People are quick to share rumours about emergency powers and expanded surveillance, some of it real or some of it not."" In the US, for example, as cities go into lockdown to stem the spread of COVID-19, people are not panic-buying just groceries but guns. Kurt Russell in the 1982 movie The Thing, which conjured a sense of obscure danger – as pandemics also do.Credit:Alamy To some extent, the same thing that makes a good Hollywood thriller, says Klein. First, there's the basic structure, the classic dramatic arc with a beginning, conflict and perhaps even a resolution – unlike the more messy and incomplete tale of COVID-19. ""Somebody eats a bat and they get kind of sick and nobody notices for a while and then everybody gets kind of sick is not a very satisfying story,"" says Klein. ""If you were to take that to your short-story writing class, people would say: 'That’s a terrible story. Come back later'."" Then there is mood. There's a very real sense of ""obscure danger"" to COVID-19 as it unfolds, and that plays straight into a more elaborate narrative. ""You don’t know where it came from, who has it or who doesn’t – where it might come from next,"" Klein says. ""It could be anybody, it could be the person next to you on the bus. That’s a good device for building dramatic tension, right? [Like the] great old movie The Thing with Kurt Russell, with a shape-shifting alien – that’s a great set-up and I think pandemics have a similar feeling to them."" Where does the toilet paper hoarding fit in, though? ""It’s weird that people go for this,"" says Klein. ""But pandemics touch on this feeling of vulnerability about your body and your health and people’s panic reaction is not to buy a bunch of quinoa, it’s to buy toilet paper – to buy things that are about cleanliness and purity to ward off the disease. In general, feelings about purity and cleanliness make for good stories, [they] can be emotionally powerful."" Some people have a conspiracy mindset. Perhaps they distrust institutions or feel disempowered by the status quo. They can be someone sharing a meme on Facebook all the way through to what Klein describes as those with ""lots of things on [the] wall with yarn going between them"", making connections where they want to find them. But more commonly, people harbour conspiracy beliefs on topics that push their buttons. ""Someone has a bad experience with the police, maybe that primes them [to believe in police cover-ups],"" Klein says. ""It’s not outlandish in the US to think that the police killed somebody and covered it up, because that actually happens. It’s probably wrong – but it’s not crazy."" There's no doubt cyberspace is fertile ground for conspiracy theories – as with the theories themselves, everything on the web is connected. Social media algorithms favour content that generates high emotional responses in people over rational or verified sites. With no fact-checkers built into platforms, a seductive conspiracy theory has little barrier from spreading: all it needs is people to react. But these theories don't only crop up online, they can surface in popular music, around the dinner table, even in mainstream media. And they didn't begin with the internet age – the US alone has a long history of conspiratorial thinking. False accusations that the British were secretly planning to enslave the American colonists even helped spark revolution in 1775. In a famous 1964 essay on The Paranoid Style in American Thinking, historian Richard Hofstadter describes conspiratorial types ""always manning the barricades of civilisation"". But it is ""the use of paranoid modes of expression by more or less normal people that makes the phenomenon significant,"" he says. There’s little point, says Klein, given the self-reinforcing nature of the theories themselves. ""I could say, ‘it’s wrong’, but that just shows I’m part of the conspiracy, too: Professor Obviously in League With the Government Helping Them Cover It Up."" In a similar vein, Facebook or YouTube removing conspiratorial misinformation can serve to make people feel like something is being suppressed. Why people continue to believe such stories in spite of scientific rebuttal reflects the reality of our information environment today, says Brandt. ""Lies travel faster than facts and, perversely, efforts to debunk a conspiracy theory can end up reinforcing it."" But some say the new ability for such theories to catch on in the mainstream through the fast, supercharged medium of the internet means they can’t just be ignored either. While banning a shock jock such as the American Alex Jones for peddling falsehoods online might make him a martyr to his devoted followers, it could also stop him reaching new audiences. And some studies suggest dismantling theories with logic can actually work – especially when the person pointing out the holes in the story is perceived to be smart and competent. Increasingly, authorities treat such misinformation contagion like their biological equivalent – proactively pushing out the right facts to inoculate people against unfounded theories or encouraging good information hygiene (such as checking sources). Even before COVID-19 had exploded into a pandemic, the World Health Organisation had teamed up with the likes of Google and Facebook to try to reach audiences with its own set of facts before conspiracy theorists could. These days, Klein says he considers such theories more as symptoms of a bigger problem, whether it be lack of transparency or a failure of communication. ""I think just trying to tackle ... conspiracy theories on their own doesn’t do much compared to trying to figure out why people believe these things and what you can do to stop that broader problem,"" he says. For most people, the more consistent and clear the messaging is from the people higher up, the better – even if that information is ""we don't know yet"". ""But there’s a sense in which trying to engage with full-bore conspiracy theorists just, at best, sucks you deeper into what they believe,"" Klein says. ""Once you fully get in, it’s very hard to get out."" The Capture (ABC iView) A British soldier is found not guilty of a crime in Afghanistan only to become the suspect in his barrister’s kidnapping in London. The incriminating evidence in both “crimes” is video footage. But is it real? The deployment of modern surveillance technologies to ping hapless citizens comes under the microscope as a London detective uncovers a web of conspiracies that, naturally, cross continents and go right to the top. Secret City (Netflix) Lake Burley Griffin takes on a sinister edge in this thriller set in our national capital, based on the book by journalists Steve Lewis and Chris Uhlmann. Jackie Weaver plays the attorney-general and minister for home affairs with mesmerising charm – ""Better get your raincoat, Mal, 'cos you've unleashed a s--storm of biblical proportions"" – while Anna Torv plays a political journalist seeking truth and transparency, despite threats to her life and career. Devs (Foxtel)  After her computer programmer boyfriend vanishes, a young woman is drawn into the smoke and mirrors world of the “Devs” division of a quantum computing company – which is developing a mysterious predictive algorithm that challenges the notion of free will. Cue spies wrestling in underground car parks, bright young things brainstorming humanity-altering code and a sense of creeping dread among the Californian redwoods.     Conspiracy (Netflix) A veritable smorgasbord of classic conspiracy theories – the Apollo 11 Moon landing was faked, Hitler lived beyond World War II, and so on – explored in 12 episodes. Sure, there are cameo appearances from Lord Lucan and Jimmy Hoffa but not everyone is a usual suspect – was martial arts star Bruce Lee murdered? – and provocations include ""Do governments sometimes sacrifice their own people for political gain?"" Surely not.  Contagion (Amazon Prime) ""In order to get scared, all you have to do is come into contact with a rumour,""  is a public health official's retort to a conspiracy theorist in this 2011 pandemic blockbuster that's been name-checked an awful lot lately. The conspiracy theorist, played by Jude Law, weaves an apparently compelling story on his blog and on TV – something about Big Pharma and a natural cure that is, of course, being covered up by the powers that be.   If you'd like some expert background on an issue or a news event, drop us a line at explainers@smh.com.au or explainers@theage.com.au.
