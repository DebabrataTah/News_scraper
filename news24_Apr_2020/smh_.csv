3,/politics/federal/australia-rejected-huge-offers-for-medical-supplies-20200424-p54mw7.html,Australia rejected huge offers for medical supplies,"A major Australian company paid for masks in a 90-tonne cargo flight from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus, and then tried to offload them to the Australian government for a profit. The large Australian supplier's offer was rejected after it sourced the medical supplies from Wuhan after the crisis had largely passed there earlier this month. Hot property: Masks have been flying off the shelves.Credit:AAP As part of a strategy to lock in long-term deals and weed out dodgy products, the Australian government has rebuffed a number of unsolicited advances from private companies for hundreds of tonnes of medical supplies to fight COVID-19, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age can reveal. In all but one case, the government has secured agreements with importers who had experience in sourcing the medical equipment. In some cases, Health Minister Greg Hunt has personally involved himself in negotiations to ensure the government was getting value for money. Mr Hunt said the Australian government's strategy from the beginning of the outbreak was to offer long-term deals, not big one-off deals at inflated prices. Replay   ""While early on there were attempts to sell masks at inflated prices, they were rejected,"" Mr Hunt said. ""What we offered and were able to secure was longer-term contracts for volume and time, not one-off inflated purchases."" In February, two teams were set up within the departments of health and industry to coordinate the national response to procuring supplies. They were charged with negotiating with major producers overseas and ramping up local production. Mr Hunt said he, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy and Prime Minister Scott Morrison went for a policy of ""containment and capacity"". ""This was tested, refined and endorsed through a rigorous National Security Committee process,"" Mr Hunt said. ""We foresaw a great global rush for test kits and locked in our supply lines early. We also established procurement teams for masks, test kits and ventilators."" In other instances, high-level diplomacy has been needed behind the scenes on deals that, on the surface, looked like commercial agreements. In April, Australia reached a deal with Taiwan to send 1 million litres of alcohol to make sanitiser and vaccines in exchange for three tonnes of material to make face masks. The strategy to only focus on long-term deals has been credited with this week's decision to resume up to 25 per cent of elective surgery from Monday, weeks before any of the government's top health advisers expected. While the Australian government has not raised any issues with receiving faulty equipment, defective testing kits from China have been reported by governments in Britain, Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands. The desperation for supplies became so intense that Britain decided to accept a risky ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer from two Chinese companies for two million home test kits for at least $20 million, which were later found to be faulty. In the United States a cheque worth $5.6 million for 1.5 million masks from a Chinese middleman was reportedly handed over in a McDonald's car park in Illinois. In the private sector, the combination of travel bans and sky-rocketing demand sent prices for masks through the roof. In some pharmacies across NSW and Victoria, the cost of a single N95 mask jumped from $1.30 to $38.50 - a 1500 per cent increase that has been referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Chemist Warehouse chief operating officer Mario Tascone said there had been a ""lot of sharks"" in the market. ""I can see where other people can get into trouble out there,"" Mr Tascone said. Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone said there had been ""massive competitive pressure put on dwindling amounts of production around the world"". ""I have colleagues overseas who have either fallen ill or lost their lives to COVID-19,"" he said.

4,/national/back-to-school-plan-gives-private-students-hsc-advantage-educators-warn-20200424-p54n2v.html,"Back-to-school plan gives private students HSC advantage, educators warn","The NSW government's back-to-school plan has created an unfair system for this year's HSC, with educators warning students at private schools will have twice as much face-to-face learning in term two as their public school counterparts. The HSC  exams will go ahead in 2020, the NSW Education Standards Authority confirmed on Friday, with the timetable to be confirmed in mid-May and the results to be released in mid-December. But if public schools follow the goverment's staged return model for year 12 - one day a week for four weeks from May 11, then two days for another four - their HSC candidates will have 12 days of face-to-face teaching in term two, while private school students who go back full time will have 40 days. HSC examinations will go ahead in 2020.Credit:Marina Neil The president of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the discrepancy put the 2020 HSC at risk. ""The model introduces a profound inequity in preparation,"" he said. ""Under these unfair conditions, the HSC could not continue. It would appear that the Premier's office failed to consider these consequences when devising their plan."" Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Tuesday that all government students, including those in year 12, would be asked to attend school for one day a week from May 11, and that would slowly increase until term 3, when all students would attend full time. Private schools supported a return to school in principle but can make their own decisions on how to do it. Many are sending year 12 back first for full-time, face-to-face learning from mid-May. Those schools include Trinity Grammar, St Catherine's School, SCEGGs Darlinghurst and Catholic high schools such as Emmaus Catholic College. One source close to HSC planning said the differing amount of face-to-face teaching over term two raised a ""real issue about the credibility of the HSC. Students will put in for misadventure and their misadventure is that they attend a government school."" Students are upset. On an HSC discussion forum yesterday, one student urged her peers to write to Ms Berejiklian and complain. ""Well this isn't fair,"" wrote another. ""Not that I wanted to go to school but it gives private students an advantage."" Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the government's plan gave principals the flexibility to accommodate year 12 students in a way that best suited the school community. ""[NESA will] continue to work through the details of the HSC for 2020 to ensure equity for students in all systems,"" she said. Craig Petersen, the president of the Secondary Principals Council - which represents public school principals, said some educators were concerned this year's HSC ""would not be a level playing field"". But public school principals were already working to maximise class time for year 12, he said, while still adhering to government directions to bring back all students for one day a week. ""Some will be bringing [year 12] back to class,"" he said. ""Others will continue with the online learning environment. Principals will have the flexibility to do whatever they can. We are fairly happy with that."" Mr Petersen has asked the Department of Education to consider altering the second phase of the return-to-school plan - when students are due to return two days a week - to prioritise year 12. The Teachers' Federation is pushing for year 12 and kindergarten to return first, a model supported by the Catholic school sector, in which secondary schools are prioritising year 12. The federation said the one-day model would cause huge logistical challenges. Weeks of simmering tensions between the union and the government surfaced this week, when Ms Berejiklian accused the union of wanting students to do remote learning at home indefinitely - a claim rejected by Mr Gavrielatos. Meanwhile, NESA confirmed HSC exams would go ahead this year, and results would be released in mid-December as originally planned. NESA had previously confirmed that students would get their HSC in 2020 but had not clarified that the exams would proceed. Authorities can determine results on the basis of assessment marks or teacher estimates, as the United Kingdom is doing after cancelling its leaving exams. A meeting of the authority's COVID-19 response committee yesterday decided to proceed with the exams. A timetable will be released by May 15. Sources told the Herald that any changes to the start or finish dates would likely be minor.

5,/national/what-does-covid-19-do-to-the-body-and-what-s-it-like-to-have-the-illness-20200302-p5465a.html,What does COVID-19 do to the body and what's it like to have the illness?,"A cough, a clammy forehead, shadows on the lungs.  Most people infected in the viral pandemic now sweeping the globe will come down with only a mild case of the mystery illness. Some won’t know they’ve had it at all. But when it's bad, it can mount an attack on the whole body – and start a storm in the lungs. How it plays out depends on the two factors important to any invasion: the strength of your defences and the strength (or dose) of what you’ve been hit with. Connor Reed, 25, knows well the racking cough and spiking fever of the illness now called COVID-19. He says he came down with it late last year in the centre of the initial outbreak, Wuhan in China. He still lives just a 20-minute walk from the wet market where it's believed the strain jumped from wild animals into humans.  At first, Reed seemed to just have a cold. A week on, then early December, he was already feeling better when a fever hit, and a cough. His whole body started to ache. Another week went by. He thought he was on the mend until the cough became deeper, seeming to settle at the bottom of his lungs. ""It was hard to breathe,"" Reed says. ""Even walking to the bathroom, I felt like I was running out of air. My ears hurt from it, I lost my balance at times. It started to get scary, like the worst flu I've ever had."" Reed ended up in hospital and, after a full day of testing, he says doctors told him he had a ""new kind of pneumonia"". Fortunately, he was fit and healthy: his life didn't appear to be in danger. Steroid inhalers helped reduce inflammation in his lungs and, more than a month after that first sniffle, Reed recovered. When he called the hospital in early January to ask more about his test results, they told him what was about to hit headlines around the world in just a matter of days – a new kind of coronavirus had been identified in humans. Reed was one of the earliest suspected cases. Four months on, what do we now know about COVID-19 and how the body reacts? What is treatment like? And how long does recovery take? Connor Reed, 25, in Wuhan, China. Having recovered from one of the earliest suspected cases of the coronavirus COVID-19, he is hoping to return to Brisbane, Australia.Credit:Facebook You can’t see the virus with the naked eye – it’s nanometres wide. But when someone is infected, they can shed it, shooting viral particles at least a metre into the air in water droplets from their nose and mouth, usually through coughing or sneezing. Viruses infect a new host by harnessing our own cellular machinery to replicate. To get in, they need the key – a receptor within a cell they can bind to. Which cell a virus latches onto largely determines where it will spread throughout the body – and helps guide treatment. The four main coronaviruses found in humans tend to colonise only the nose and throat. Collectively, they cause about one in four cases of the common cold and symptoms are mild: a runny nose, a sore throat, sometimes a cough or a fever. But since 2003, three dangerous coronavirus illnesses have emerged in humans: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which also spawned global panic when it exploded onto the scene 20 years ago, the more deadly but less common MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and now the latest, COVID-19, which has already infected more than 2 million people and killed about 133,000. All three attack the lungs as well as the sinuses, sometimes developing into viral pneumonia – and, because they're new, there's little natural immunity to fight them off. COVID-19 is about 75 per cent similar to the SARS strain, and even thought to bind to the same cell receptors (ACE2), which are largely found in the lungs. Early studies suggest this virus might be better at hacking into that receptor than SARS, which is why it's more infectious, says Professor Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. A spokesman for the Australian Department of Health offered a different theory: the new virus appears to be replicating fastest in the nose and throat, rather than the lungs. That could make it more transmissible but also perhaps less fatal than the other two coronavirus outbreaks. To find the virus, doctors need to catch it in the act, either by swabbing a sample directly from the nose and throat or in lung phlegm or by singling out the body’s immune response to the infection in a blood test. The new strain has already been found in the lungs, nose, throat, even in faeces, says infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre. It can hitch a ride in the bloodstream to other organs such as the kidneys, liver, intestines and possibly the heart, brain and central nervous system, too. But both methods of testing can return false negatives - a throat or nasal swab can miss the virus (because it's actually replicating lower down in the lungs). A blood test, which is not yet widely available outside of China, can be performed too early - some people will take up to 9 days to produce antibodies to fight off a virus - or it could confuse the antibody response with another virus. Professor Lewin adds, ""Early on, you had doctors in China diagnosing just off chest scans because you can see that lung inflammation, even if it's not severe."" Now, Sydney scientists have developed a fast training tool to help frontline healthcare workers spot COVID-19 in lung scans. Still, infectious disease physician and microbiologist Professor Peter Collignon says it’s not yet clear if everyone gets the new virus in their lungs. “Finding it down there isn't a tipping point [for severity] by any means. Some children have it in their lungs but display no symptoms,"" he says. ""But it might not have travelled all the way down from the upper respiratory area in every case."" Much of what we know about COVID-19 comes from studies of the first 55,000-odd cases in China, which found more than 80 per cent of people could fight off the illness without serious complications, even if they developed pneumonia. Lungs cleared, coughs eased and fevers broke. Anecdotally, some people have likened the infection to ""three weeks in hell"", racked by chills and struggling to breathe, while others have reported only a sore throat, a small cough, even no symptoms at all. Hollywood actor Tom Hanks offered an early public glimpse into life as a COVID-19 patient on March 11 when he revealed he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had both tested positive while in Australia shooting his latest film From hospital isolation on the Gold Coast, Hanks wrote of the illness's onset: ""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too."" More public figures from actor Idris Elba to Prime Minister Boris Johnson have since been diagnosed. ""I've developed mild symptoms,"" Johnson said from isolation at home on March 27. ""That is to say, a fever and a persistent cough."" When his fever remained high more than 10 days later, he was moved to hospital, and then briefly into intensive care. On April 12, he left hospital, crediting its doctors and nurses with saving his life as ""it could have gone either way"". Based on data collected in China, most patients seem to have: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat, and nausea or diarrhoea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS. Less than five per cent of cases so far involve a blocked nose. With early symptoms deceptively similar to the common cold or flu, one sign of infection may be a loss of smell (and an accompanying reduction in taste), as the virus attacks that part of the respiratory system. Sometimes people infected with the virus who otherwise feel fine will find they cannot smell as usual - though experts say the effects are not permanent and the sudden loss of the sense is far from a ""test"" for the virus. (Not all patients report losing smell and the symptom is also associated with other common colds and viruses). In the case of COVID-19, Professor Collignon says patients generally appear to have mild symptoms for the first week or so. In severe cases, they can intensify into pneumonia during the second and, in rarer cases, the infection will turn unexpectedly deadly.  At the World Health Organisation, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward warns when danger strikes, it's often fast-moving. Doctors report patients can go downhill quickly during those ""critical"" second and third weeks and urge people with or suspected to have the virus to monitor their symptoms, particularly their breathing and fever. Infectious diseases physician Sanjaya Senanayake says he's seen patients develop ""bad shortness of breath"" around the second week of symptoms. ""Then if they're going to get very sick, about two and a half days later, they [usually] start to develop fluid in their lungs."" CT scans from a 77-year-old man with COVID-19 in China over 10 days, showing ground-glass opacity of the lungs and lesions. 
The man died 10 days after the final scan.Credit:The Lancet medical journal  On scans, they call it ground glass – a white mist over the usual empty black of the lungs. In some cases, there are bright spots, eerily similar to the “honeycomb-shaped” lesions left by SARS, but mostly COVID-19 makes a finer and more-even pattern across both lungs. This inflammation is a sign the body is fighting back against the virus – in that battle, the lungs are ground zero. But Professor Collignon warns sometimes the collateral damage can be worse than the bug itself. As the immune system ramps up its defences, blood vessels start to leak and the lungs can be flooded with cellular debris, making it harder for them to pump oxygen to the rest of the body – and harder for patients to draw breath. ""They start to drown,"" Professor Collignon says. Falling blood oxygen levels put pressure on other organs, in particular the heart. More systems can start to fail, and blood pressure too, which, if it falls low enough can tip the body into septic shock, a whole-body infection. ""Even if the virus spreads to the heart or the kidneys and damages them, the real cause of death is still probably going to be oxygen levels falling and setting everything else off,"" Professor Collignon says. ""If you're an older person or already unwell and those organs are weaker, it can be the straw that breaks the camel's back."" While there is a theory that people with already compromised immune systems might escape this effect and so cope with an infection better than expected, Professor Collignon warns they are especially vulnerable to the other big killer – co-infection. Usually being hit with two bugs at once is rare, though not impossible. But as the virus chews through cells, it leaves the lungs less able to filter out germs picked up from the nose and throat – and wide open to a case of the flu or even a bout of bacterial pneumonia. (The first man to die from COVID-19 in Thailand was also sick with dengue fever.) During the deadly 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, most victims died not from the original virus but due to these second-wave bacterial pneumonia infections. Fortunately medicine has advanced a lot since then, making such complications much easier to treat. But as the virus continues its march across the world, clinicians are gathering concerning evidence that it may also directly damage organs besides the lungs including the heart, kidneys, liver, even the central nervous system, further complicating treatment in severe cases. This was also observed to some extent during SARS, and MERS is known for its at times aggressive attack on the kidneys, where the protein receptors it latches onto (not ACE2 but DPP-4) are also found in high numbers. So far, the WHO reports about 20 per cent of cases become severe, requiring medical intervention for serious breathing difficulties and falling blood oxygen levels. Of those, 6 per cent have been pushed into critical care – as multiple organs begin to fail alongside the lungs or septic shock sets in. About 3.4 per cent have died. But experts expect the real death rate is actually much lower, given so many mild cases will likely go undiagnosed. While anyone can catch the virus, older people and those with other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease are most at risk of fatal complications. (""Over the age of 50, the immune system starts to fall apart,"" Professor MacIntyre explains). But in Italy, where the virus has gained a particularly deadly foothold, doctors warn that younger patients (in their 30s, 40s and 50s) were also presenting to overwhelmed emergency departments needing help to breathe. Some have even raised the prospect of an age limit for intensive care to free up beds for younger cases as life-saving machines such as ventilators become worth their weight in gold. Data since complied from elsewhere in Europe and North America also reflects a concerning number of hospitalisations among people under 55, prompting warnings for younger adults to take COVID-19 more seriously. As of April 6, 448 of Australia's then 5795 cases were in hospital, 96 of them in intensive care. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said many of those people were young - in their 30s. ""This is not just an old person's disease,"" he said. ""Those young people don't have [other] risk factors."" While so far those who have died in Australia have been over 50, people in their 20s have seen the highest number of coronavirus infections of any age bracket. So far internationally very few children have been diagnosed or suffered serious cases globally – a phenomenon also observed during SARS. Still, they are not immune and some have died from the illness, including the heart-breaking case of a six-week old baby in the US. Smokers are considered more at risk, as early studies show the same cell receptors the virus hijacks in the lungs increase with cigarette smoke. But pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers so far do not appear in any heightened danger, as they were during the last pandemic, the 2009 swine flu. Still they should take precautions as they are known to be more susceptible to other common respiratory viruses. Whatever your personal vulnerability, the dose of virus you first receive – say, from touching a contaminated door knob versus caring for an infected person over several days – also plays a big part in how your body copes. ""The higher the dose the faster you will get sick, and the harder it will be on you,"" Professor MacIntyre says. That could explain why otherwise young and healthy medical workers have died from the disease. Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old doctor who blew the whistle on early cases of COVID-19, went through a gamut of treatments after falling ill himself, including antivirals, antibiotics, even having his blood pumped through an artificial lung, but he died weeks later. As with SARS, clusters of severe infection are emerging in hospitals and households as people come into sustained close contact. Despite the breakneck speed of global research, a vaccine for COVID-19 is still many months away. And, while antivirals and therapies that block diseases such as malaria, Ebola and HIV are being trialled against the new disease in some parts of the world, including Australia, treatment is largely about managing complications – providing oxygen, keeping up fluids and monitoring how the body is coping. Antibiotics don't work on the virus as it is not caused by bacteria but they can be deployed against secondary infections. If breathing starts to fall, respirators and other measures will kick in to keep the lungs going. As Professor Lewin explains, doctors have a key choice when treating any new virus: is it better to block it directly with antiviral therapies as in the case of HIV or should they also dampen down the body's immune response using drugs such as Interferon, to minimise the fall-out damage? ""Sometimes that can help but sometimes it means the infection overwhelms,"" Professor Lewin says. ""It didn't work with SARS but there's been some success with MERS. Already for this, there's been candidate [therapies] that look good in test tubes, but we need trials. China has about 70 going, testing different [approaches] but they're actually struggling to enrol people now as cases fall."" No vaccine exists for either SARS or MERS - the former died out within about nine months so an inoculation never hit the market while the less common MERS has struggled to attract research funding since it emerged in 2012. After the big Ebola outbreak of 2014, a global group formed to speed up research into vaccines and MERS was recently identified as a priority. ""Then this new one hit,"" Professor Lewin says. Professor Collignon thinks it unlikely any of the potential treatments now being tested against COVID-19 will save the day before a vaccine hits the market – without larger trials, he warns, small studies can miss big problems on roll-out. Experts also warn of increased pressure on hospitals  if severe coronavirus cases hit wards all at once. While Australia's healthcare system is strong compared to other countries, it's population is also older, Professor MacIntyre notes, meaning more demand for intensive care. To slow down the virus and avoid a ""pinch"" around flu season, Australia has followed other countries in rolling out stricter containment measures such as quarantining suspected cases, shutting down gatherings and ordering people to stay home except for essential reasons. So far it appears to be working - a surge in new infections in mid-March has now begun to flatten. Most people with COVID-19 present to hospital because they're having trouble breathing, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. Once admitted and getting oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but others will need ventilators or other machines to keep their lungs and organs working. Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a breathing machine known as a ventilator, whether they know it or not. But Dr Suzi Nou at the Australian Society of Anaesthetists says that while a patient having routine surgery will need a ventilator for minutes or hours – perhaps a few days in intensive care – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. Australia is already doubling the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to 4000 - some are being freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery. But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou. It's those doctors and nurses who will need help to keep coming to work in the weeks and months ahead, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Retired healthcare workers as well as medical students are now being drafted into the fight. Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” Replay   Professor MacIntyre says it's too early to say if this disease will result in any permanent damage for severe cases– such as the lung tissue scarring seen in some SARS and MERS patients. But a full recovery typically takes about 10 days to a month. Symptoms tend to clear up within a fortnight in mild cases or six weeks for more serious, Associate Professor Senanayake says.  Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. So far, more than 300,000 people have already recovered worldwide. With these virus-fighting antibodies in their system, many experts expect they will remain immune for some time, though it is unclear for how long. Recovering from a virus usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. For COVID-19, there have already been cases of people cleared of the virus, only to test positive again days later or, in the case of one woman, more than a month down the line. But while experts say it's possible to be re-infected again, it's more likely the virus was still in their system. Some studies have even suggested it can lie dormant in other parts of the body for weeks - with the longest period of infectiousness recorded as 37 days so far. ""But in some cases, when people are returning persistently positive tests after getting better, they might be finding dead virus,"" Associate Professor Senanayake says. Amid a shortage of testing kits world-wide, Australia is only retesting frontline staff in health and aged care to confirm their recovery. That means official recovery data remains patchy. Most patients are instead told to wait 72 hours after symptoms disappear (provided they have already isolated for 10 days from illness onset). A federal government spokesman also said a patient who keeps testing positive after symptoms vanish is not necessarily still infectious. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve,"" he said. Back in Wuhan, Reed was cleared to leave his own home quarantine months ago but, like tens of millions of people in China, he'd spent the first three months of 2020 under lockdown in an unprecedented government effort to stem the virus's spread. On April 8, the streets finally opened again - residents waved flags and sang songs as they left their homes for the first time in 11 weeks. While the local government did not appear to pick up early cases of the virus, Reed says China took the right step, however extreme, in shutting down parts of the country - the government's data says new infections have all but stopped within its borders, even as new frontiers of the virus rage in the US and Europe. ""In Italy, it seems to be a similar thing to Wuhan,"" Reed says. ""The virus was there, but people didn't notice, it was brewing quietly for a while, and then it suddenly exploded. Now they've followed China with lockdowns. Australians need to take this seriously."" Reed was born in the UK but is now hoping to return to Brisbane, where he grew up and his family still live. ""I'm likely immune now, I feel fine, but I know I've gotten very lucky.

6,/national/since-you-asked-your-covid-19-questions-answered-20200323-p54cy7.html,What effect does weather have on COVID-19? Your questions answered,"Since it emerged in China in late 2019, the new coronavirus has infected more than two million people and claimed nearly 160,000 lives. To stop a pandemic that spreads from person to person in close quarters, the world has largely shut down, with borders closed, streets empty and whole cities going into quarantine. Australia has its own strict measures to avoid the terrible scenes playing out in places such as Italy and the United States, where hospital systems are now being overwhelmed. We are told to live our lives further apart – literally – by avoiding gatherings, staying home and keeping 1.5 metres clear of each other.  As we learn more about this virus, questions from you, our readers, are flooding in. Our explainer team, as well as our health, science and data reporters, will answer as many of them as we can. And when new information comes to light, we'll bring you updates too – with the latest featured up top in this story. Here's what we know so far. The virus behind the pandemic is tiny -110 nanometres wide to be precise - but it behaves differently to the other two deadly coronaviruses to emerge in humans, SARS and MERS. Up until now, most of the evidence came from doctor's charts - the disease it causes, COVID-19, is less deadly than either previous outbreak but it can spread between people a lot easier. In less than five months, it's infected more than 2 million worldwide. New early research out of four major labs in the US has found the virus is also ""remarkably"" resilient in the air, staying infectious for more than 12 hours. It is still unclear how much of the virus you would need to inhale to get sick. But researchers from America's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and elsewhere found, unlike SARS and MERS, particles of the new virus could still infect cells in a dish and looked intact under the microscope after 16 hours. ""That's very unusual, we'd expect them to be ripped apart in the air by then,"" says infectious disease aerobiologist Professor Chad Roy, who co-wrote the paper. ""We scientists don't use this kind of bold language lightly so health authorities need to take note."" The work has not yet been put through rigorous peer review, released on April 18 in a preprint as scientists around the world fast-track their normal ""protracted"" process in the face of a fast-moving and dangerous new virus. But Professor Roy says the team are confident in the findings as they had been replicated across four different labs, including the US army's virology hub Fort Detrick. ""We're all running under a fire drill, there's still so much we don't know about this virus and it's all so urgent,"" he says. ""Of course we need more research, but in science when you see a warning light blinking on like this, you need to pay attention."" While scientists agree the virus is not airborne in the same way as other infectious diseases such as measles, they are split on the question of how big a risk it poses in the air. The World Health Organisation says there’s not enough evidence to say the virus can jump from person to person in small or aerosolised particles. It’s mostly shed by larger water droplets from the nose and mouth, tiny balls of mucus, salt and virus that can shoot out up to about a metre when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they land on and contaminate surfaces, but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. But the WHO raised eyebrows back in March when it emphatically ""fact-checked"" the idea that coronavirus might be airborne as ""incorrect"" over Twitter. For doctors (and the general public) the term airborne calls to mind measles, or the film Outbreak, where a pathogen primarily spreads by lingering in the air. Experts agree that's not how COVID-19 is moving through the community. If it were, some experts such as infectious disease physician Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say the shape of the pandemic would likely look different – moving faster and striking down more people without close contact to known cases. But while large particles tend to carry more virus than smaller aerosols, Professor Roy says it's been assumed by health authorities such as the WHO that only big droplets will carry any live virus at all. His work in the US now adds to a growing body of evidence COVID-19 virus was also an airborne pathogen, he says. Still that doesn't mean you'll catch it just from passing someone on the street. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. ""I don't know all the data the WHO have and this is not the only piece of the puzzle, but it's an important one,"" Professor Roy says. ""I think as COVID-19 continues we will see its infection or [reproduction number] go up. It's certainly spreading easier than SARS."" A growing number of scientists, including infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and aerosol scientist and WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska, agree the risk from aerosols has been underestimated. Warning signs are piling up, Professor Morawska says - the virus rips through a cruise ship even after passengers are isolated in their cabins, a choir meets in Washington and 45 out of the 60 singers leave the two hour rehearsal infected even though none have symptoms. As an Australian Department of Health spokeswoman also noted, viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet (which are classed as anything more than five microns in size). They can leave the body as both. “It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s that they only travel a metre,” Professor Morawska said. “But we know more now. We've already shown other viruses like the flu [that mostly] shed in droplets can also spread from breathing. [In a] pandemic, we need to assume the worst. We don’t know how much you would have to inhale to get infected, the smaller particles at least carry less virus, but it’s possible."" Professor Morawska, who heads up the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Queensland University of Technology, is now working with scientists from around the world to write enhanced guidelines for potential aerosol transmission. On April 21, the Department of Health said COVID-19 was ""not as efficient"" at spreading in the air as other diseases considered to be airborne - a greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces. Of the new research, the government said such lab experiments were useful but at present physical distancing and hand hygiene had suppressed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. On paper, early studies into the new virus show mixed results – some found it in the air of hospitals treating patients, some didn’t. All viruses start to break up once they leave the body and different conditions will speed that up - usually the warmer the better. One laboratory study by scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the virus in the air for up to three hours but found the new virus did not last any longer than the original SARS strain. The WHO has since pointed out that such studies do not reflect real-world conditions. One study tracked a cluster of infections at a restaurant in China back to one asymptomatic patient - those who had caught the virus were found to be sitting in the direct flow of air pushed by the air conditioner, suggesting, according to the researchers, that droplets were the main route of transmission. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier in April saying the current research supports the possibility that COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a small degree during SARS. But back then in 2003, Associate Professor Senanayake notes the virus generally aerosolised in hospitals where treatments such as intubation and ventilation increase the risk. The WHO itself has issued warnings to healthcare workers that this may happen again and many wards treating COVID-19 operate as if the infection is airborne, including in Australia. ""We're all following that really closely and it seems to be holding up well,"" Associate Professor Senanyake said. Face masks: recommended in the US but not in Australia.Credit:The Age Face masks can protect against the droplets that spread the virus and are now a common sight on the streets of many cities around the world such as Hong Kong. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put healthcare workers at risk. All the same, calls are growing in many Western countries for a wider take-up of face masks to slow outbreaks. In the US, the CDC has already reversed its own advice, given research showing even people without symptoms can spread the virus. It now urges people to wear cloth masks whenever they are somewhere poorly ventilated or can’t keep their distance from others, such as a supermarket aisle. Its guidance to healthcare workers also states that, while the extent of aerosol transmission is still unclear, the virus can spread when someone ""coughs, sneezes or talks"". Aerosol scientist Professor Lidia Morawska agrees with the move, saying masks aren't needed outdoors but are a good idea where ventilation is poor. But infectious disease experts Professor Raina MacIntyre and Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say they are not as necessary in Australia as in places such as New York, where community transmission is now rampant. Experts all agree good protective gear is crucial for healthcare workers - Professor Roy says the new US research underscores the need for high quality masks that protect against aerosols as well as droplets. It’s also unclear how much home-made masks or bandannas and scarves will block virus-laden droplets. Some experts warn widespread use of DIY masks could leave people with a false sense of security - and an urge to touch (and so possibly contaminate) their face more often as they adjust them. Australian health authorities have indicated they are reviewing their own advice on masks, as they do all their guidelines, but stress it still stands. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has urged people not to ""waste"" masks and notes they should be handled carefully and changed regularly (Nobel prizewinner and medical researcher Peter Doherty recommends sterilising used masks rather than throwing them away, given the shortage). Right now, health authorities say anyone who spends more than two hours in an enclosed room with an infected person has been exposed to the virus. But Professor Morawska warns there needs to be more focus on the need to opt for natural ventilation by throwing windows open wherever possible rather than using air circulation systems. Associate Professor Senanayake says air-conditioning and heating could still be considered safe in most settings as droplets will not travel that far. And the Department of Health agreed that, while there was not enough data on the question, the risk from ventilation was low outside healthcare settings. NSW Health said it considered air-conditioners and heating safe to use even when people in the home had COVID-19. ""What is important for suspected and confirmed cases is to try and stay in a room separate to the rest of their family and, if possible, use a different bathroom ... to avoid the spread of COVID-19 through droplets ... and surface contamination,"" a spokeswoman said. ""It is only in the very sickest patients, who are in our specialist ICUs, or patients who require hospital treatments like intubation, where we are likely to see the virus be airborne."" US President Donald Trump offered an optimistic view, back in February, of how the coronavirus pandemic would unfold: “In theory, when it gets a little warmer [the virus] miraculously goes away,” he said. But while viruses tend to break down faster outside the body in warmer temperatures, experts warn this does not mean the northern hemisphere summer will drive out this particular virus. COVID-19 is new so scientists are looking at similar viruses such as the flu and the more common coronaviruses that cause colds to help them predict how it might behave. These viruses do follow a rough seasonal pattern, peaking over winter. Experts have a number of theories for why this is so – from people crowding together indoors to the effects of the cold, dry air to the natural sterilising powers of the sunlight seen less in winter – and there may not be one single cause. Here in the southern hemisphere, where the temperatures are only just starting to fall, the timing of COVID-19’s emergence means health authorities in Australia are concerned that caseloads will reach a natural peak alongside our annual winter flu season, causing a crush in hospital wards. That’s why everyone is being urged to have their flu shot and follow tough containment measures that are, so far, “flattening the curve” of Australia’s outbreak. US infectious disease expert Professor Ian Lipkin, who is himself recovering from a case of COVID-19, told ABC radio that the risk was likely to increase in Australia as winter arrived so “it’s going to be very, very important that you stay the course”. Professor Carola Vinuesa at the John Curtin School of Medical Research has said that, while it was too early to tell with any certainty, we can ""probably expect a little bit more transmission over the winter”. Still, even if the virus follows the usual pattern, it is spreading in warm climates right now so human interventions will play the greatest role in stopping it, she told the Australian Academy of Science. Nobel prizewinner and immunologist Professor Peter Doherty says he thinks it more likely the flu season is spawned by more time spent close together indoors during winter, and says social distancing measures will play the biggest role in determining the shape of the new COVID-19 pandemic. The first dangerous coronavirus to emerge in humans, SARS, was stamped out after nine months – just as summer arrived in the northern hemisphere. But experts say it was fast containment, including exhaustive case detection and isolation, that put an end to it, not the weather. In a “rapid expert consultation” sent to the White House on April 7, a prestigious panel at the US National Academies of Science, Medicine and Engineering warned this new virus was unlikely to wane as the sun came out. More research was needed, they said. What early studies had been done were patchy, usually performed under lab conditions. While there are early signs the virus might break down faster in the heat, evidence is also emerging that it can spread further in the air and last on surfaces longer than other comparable viruses, which will factor into how it spreads. What's more, the other two deadly coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, “have not demonstrated any evidence of seasonality following their emergence” and even the rare influenza strains that have morphed into pandemics (such as the 1918 Spanish flu and, more recently, the less severe 2009 swine flu) did not follow the typical pattern. All had a peak second wave about six months after their emergence, regardless of the season. “Given that countries currently in summer climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid [COVID-19] spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,” the report said. And if temperature does turn out to be a factor, the authors note it will likely be less pronounced than in the existing viruses in circulation such as the cold and flu where there is at least partial herd immunity in the population already. Scientists say the virus is genetically linked to bats but new research suggests it might have first jumped into the endangered (and heavily trafficked) pangolin (above) before crossing into humans.Credit:Getty  Scientists think the virus jumped from wild animals into humans, likely in late 2019 somewhere in a bustling wet market in Wuhan, central China, where many of the first cases of COVID-19 emerged. Such wet markets are notorious breeding grounds for disease as stressed animals from all corners of the world are caged close together, trading unfamiliar diseases, and then handled and butchered by humans. It happened that way with SARS, the first deadly coronavirus outbreak, and then again with the second, MERS, this time along camel trade routes and slaughterhouses in the Middle East. As people push farther into the world's last wild places, more viruses previously unknown to humanity are making the leap across species lines. But in April when China lifted lockdowns on Wuhan, it also reopened wet markets, sparking concern it hadn't learned the lesson of either SARS or COVID-19. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has slammed the move as unfathomable given what is known about the market's risks to human health (Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy echoed his concerns, saying ""zoonotic [animal] viruses are our biggest risk and clearly that risk is much greater when you have animals close together"".) The World Health Organisation has also warned against wet markets but has so far refused to condemn China for the move. WHO special envoy and UN representative Dr David Nabarro noted that the organisation cannot police countries, it can only advise them and its advice is to shut the markets down.   Breaking the wildlife trade's hold on China will not be easy - while young generations are moving away from wild meat, it has a long history in culture and traditional medicine. Add to this the staggering amount of money China has tied up in the trade as the world's biggest producer and consumer of wildlife products. Scientists have long been warning that habitat loss, global travel and a persistent appetite for wild animals has created a “perfect storm” for the next human pandemic. But the trade continues to boom, worth billions through both legal and illegal channels in South-East Asia, Europe, the US and beyond. Demand is growing alongside middle-class wealth in much of the developing world. China is now under fire for its refusal to outlaw the sale of many wild species after SARS - from the critically endangered tiger to animals linked to that earlier outbreak such as civets and bats. In February, as COVID-19 cases continued to explode within its borders, China announced seismic laws to outlaw the sale of all wildlife for food and restrict their commerce for medicine, pets or research. But by April, the government was also offering tax breaks to ship wildlife products overseas (a perk not extended to medical supplies) and even advising the public that unproven traditional remedies including bear bile could help patients critically ill with COVID-19. Beijing had initially blamed the wildlife trade for the outbreak, but its Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao has since ignored research showing the natural origins of the virus in favour of unfounded conspiracy theories that it did not emerge in China at all. One of the main reasons this coronavirus is so dangerous is because it can spread well before symptoms show up. That makes the virus fairly infectious, and it also means government responses are often one to two weeks behind. Currently, the best way of tracking coronavirus is testing people with symptoms – but what if we were able to find out where the virus was before the sore throats and high fevers hit? Australian experts have begun tests on Canberra sewage to see if they can pick up traces of coronavirus in our faeces. It's not glamorous, but it could be lifesaving. A study out of the Netherlands appears to suggest that the first coronavirus traces emerge in sewage matter roughly a week before symptoms appear in humans. If Australia sees the same results, the government could get a headstart on the virus, better allocating health resources to outbreak areas, or even tightening and loosening social distancing measures based on whether the virus is present in your local sewage. To do the testing, Australian National University epidemiologists will piggyback off the daily sewage tests already required for wastewater management. Scientists will centrifuge samples (spin them to separate fluids from solids) then test for the virus. It's not yet known whether a rough number of coronavirus cases can be determined from examining the sewage – they’re looking into that, too. – Max Koslowski Video calling is having a moment, thanks to tight social distancing rules across the globe, and Zoom is now the service of choice for everything from family catch-ups to hosting virtual parties. Zoom offers free video conference calls, up to 40 minutes in duration and capable of connecting as many as a 100 people, with the service almost entirely catering to a business audience prior to the coronavirus pandemic. The app is easy to use, with no logins required, and has a number of other bells and whistles thrown in that’s made it a hit. There’s the Touch Up My Appearance beauty filter to make users look their best during calls and the virtual backgrounds feature that lets you choose any image – a tropical island, a lavish palace interior – as your background. But these same features make Zoom a risky service as well. The biggest problem is that of uninvited guests taking advantage of the lax security settings on Zoom to intrude on virtual meetings. With consumers sending links (meeting IDs) of Zoom meetings across various social media platforms, that information is being used by online trolls to sign in and disrupt proceedings. The other big issue has been Zoom’s usual practice of letting people jump into a meeting without providing the necessary credentials, again letting trolls listen in on a conversation. Zoom, by its own admission, was unprepared for the spike in demand and has moved to plug some of the security holes. But it’s a work in progress and a number of organisations, from Google and NASA to schools across the US and Singapore, have already banned the use of the service. With social distancing rules to remain in place for some time, Zoom’s unlikely to see a dip in usage and for those keen to press ahead with their virtual cocktail parties and book clubs on the app, here’s our guide to using the services safely.   – Supratim Adhikari  It appears that, as with SARS, it's possible for our pets to catch the virus from us in very rare cases. But despite hysteria about an asymptomatic Pomeranian in Hong Kong returning a ""weak positive"" test for COVID-19 (and a tiger also catching a mild dose, from a keeper, at the Bronx Zoo in New York), the World Health Organisation stresses there's no evidence the virus can jump the other way, from pets to people, and no one should abandon their animals. Hong Kong authorities tested 17 dogs and eight cats from households with confirmed COVID-19 cases or people in close contact with confirmed patients and found two dogs that tested positive – the Pomeranian and a German Shepherd – but they did not appear to show symptoms. They concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the virus to human beings, although they could test positive if exposed by their owners. If it were possible to catch coronavirus from your pet, two veterinary experts looking into the US tiger case told The New York Times, it would have already become a clear factor in this pandemic, given the huge numbers of cases, and other scientists have since echoed the sentiment: there hasn’t been a single case. While the virus is thought to have jumped from wild animals into humans and mutated, that was one “spillover” event, likely at a wet market where wildlife were caged and killed in close contact with people, and there is no evidence of another species jump. One small study that did cause a stir online found that cats and ferrets could be infected and pass on the virus to one another (dogs and farm animals were less susceptible) but it’s important to note the context for the research – animals in the study were deliberately infected with very high doses of the virus to see if a possible vaccine could be tested on them. And researchers did not find they could then give the virus to humans. “We’re not overly concerned about people contracting COVID-19 through contact with dogs and cats,” the American Veterinary Medical Association's chief veterinary officer Gail Golab has told The Washington Post, adding “the virus survives best on smooth surfaces, such as countertops and doorknobs. Porous materials, such as pet fur, tend to absorb and trap pathogens, making it harder to contract them through touch.” “The current spread of coronavirus in humans is the result of human-to-human transmission,” said Australian Veterinary Association President Dr Julia Crawford on March 11. “To date, there is no evidence that pets can spread the disease, or that they can become sick.” The WHO is now investigating the case of the tiger – which showed mild symptoms but is said to be recovering well – as well as a possible infection in a cat in Belgium and the two dogs in Hong Kong to understand how pets may get the virus. It’s “important we remain respectful and kind” to any animals co-infected with humans, says Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program. “They’re victims like the rest of us.” In Australia, the federal government says there have been no cases detected in any domestic animals here (pets or livestock) or wildlife, and the current virus is spreading between people not animals. Testing for the virus in animals requires different testing kits and, while Australia “does have capabilities” to do it, it's not a priority given “the latest scientific information”. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also does not consider there to be evidence of a threat from animals. It instead advises you to “protect pets” if you yourself are sick, limiting contact, but otherwise you should exercise the usual precautions around animals. With pets now revelling in their owners being home with them under strict new social distancing measures, follow commonsense hygiene. “What owners can do is what we always recommend,"" says Dr Crawford. ""Please practise good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after handling your pets, as well as their food.” You can still take your pets to the vet and walk them but don't attempt to disinfect your cat, it could hurt them. Yes. Some people will be infected without symptoms or very mild symptoms. To test for COVID-19 right now, clinicians need to either take a direct sample of the virus, from a throat or nose swab or in lung phlegm, and examine its genetic code. Those tests are considered very accurate but in some cases if they miss the virus – say, because it is further down in the lungs and someone doesn’t cough up any phlegm (or sputum) – they can return a false negative. That’s why tests are often repeated, especially for patients recovering and returning to the community. Blood tests, which look for the body’s immune response to the infection, can also be used but are not yet widely available outside China, and bring their own false negative risks – antibodies deployed by the body to fight off the virus can take more than a week to form so may not show up if the test is performed too early into the illness, or they could mistake them for those used against another virus. This is also true of the rapid finger-prick tests being checked in Australia right now by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, after problems overseas. A government spokesman said these are therefore not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA sample or PCR test and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. Scientists aren’t sure yet but they think it most likely. Recovering from a virus leaves us armed with those aforementioned antibodies in our system to fight it off, and usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Many experts say reports of people appearing to catch this new virus twice are probably best explained by false negative tests clearing them of the infection too early (when the virus had actually remained in their system) rather than catching it a second time. Associate Professor Senanayake says the virus collected by the later tests may even be dead. Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. Countries that have ""flattened their curve"" and dramatically slowed outbreaks have carried out exhaustive testing and contact tracing. In many cases, people without symptoms are tested and health officials actively hunt for others, checking temperatures on entry to buildings. Australia's testing rates are proportionately high compared to many other countries (more than 300,000 have been done so far) but the criteria for being tested is still fairly strict due to a global shortage of testing kits, the government says. Amid increasing calls from the WHO to ""test all suspected cases"", Australia has since ramped up the operation to 10,000 tests a day and expanded that criteria, meaning frontline staff with symptoms can now qualify too. In April, states which had seen particularly large outbreaks began casting their nets wider. On April 14, Victoria expanded testing to anyone with symptoms across 40 specialist locations and NSW followed the next day. The week before, the ACT began random sample testing of those with symptoms but no other risk factors as did NSW and Queensland in some areas of community outbreak such as Brisbane and the Gold Coast.  A federal government spokesman did not give an estimated timeline of Australia's efforts to fix the testing-kit shortage but said it was ""working with public and private laboratories and with pathology suppliers to understand both international and domestic supply capacity and capability and are exploring the possibility of building further domestic capability to produce tests and reagents for COVID-19"". They also did not answer questions on how kits are being distributed to the states, as some push ahead with their own expanded testing. Australia has one of the lowest positive rates for testing in the world, Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy says, meaning authorities feel ""reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of cases in Australia and that means we can get on top of cases"" through contact tracing. That's in contrast to countries such as Iran, Italy and even the US, where Australian authorities say they likely only tested the more severe cases or, as Murphy puts it, ""when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in community that were undetected"". Still, at times Australian authorities have also faced criticism for letting contacts of cases slip through the net, most notably allowing 2700 passengers to disembark in Sydney from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, hundreds of whom later tested positive. But the states have also threatened hefty fines and even jail time for those at risk of spreading the virus who break home quarantine orders. Anyone following the international news on the pandemic will have noticed a marked variation in death rates from Covid-19 among different countries. In hard-hit Italy, for instance, the death rate among confirmed cases is around 12 per cent in the first week of April, compared with 1.75 per cent in Germany and – thus far – less than 1 per cent here. East Asian countries have generally done better, the UK, Spain and the US worse. A number of factors help account for this variation. The most significant is that the death rate will largely reflect how widely you are testing, and the age groups you test in. If, as in Germany, you test a very large number of people, many of whom are young with mild symptoms, you get a lower rate of death overall. If, as in the UK and US, you only test those who are very ill and in hospital, the converse applies: your death rate looks much higher. Per head of population, Australia’s testing regime has been ahead of many other countries. Other factors that contribute to varying death rates include: demographics such as the age profile of a country’s population overall; density of living conditions; patterns of interaction between different generations; cultural factors (such as the absence of social kissing and handshaking in Japan); and, importantly, the capacity of health systems to cope with the very ill. Germany has more than double Italy’s number of acute care beds per 100,000 people, and more than triple the UK’s acute bed capacity. In Italy, with one of the oldest populations in Europe, researchers believe that deeply ingrained habits of adult children living with, or remaining housed close to, their parents has contributed to the high fatality rate there. Younger adults, commuting into larger employment centres where the virus had been silently spreading, bring the virus back to the smaller communities where their parents live. Smoking rates may be a factor in some places. The jury is out on whether seasonality (whether a country is going into warmer or cooler weather) plays a role. – Deborah Snow No matter where you live, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised that there are now really only four acceptable reasons to go out: The bottom line, as distilled into those text message flying around from the federal government: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care"". Whenever you go out you must stick with just those in your household or up to one other external person, and you should keep your distance from others (about two steps or 1.5 metres). Wash or sanitise your hands regularly and ditch the handshake and the kiss hello. In enforcing these rules, authorities are emphasising a ""common sense"" approach. As NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says: ""If you're questioning whether you should be doing something, best to give it a miss."" We put a list of your questions to governments and are including the answers below, as we get them, and in more detail in this dedicated explainer here. In Victoria, Chief Medical Officer Brett Sutton has ruled out fishing, boating, hunting, camping, golf and ""all recreational activity beyond basic exercise"" under a ban lasting until at least May 11. ""Victorians must change their behaviour to change the course of this epidemic,"" he said on April 2. “Stop looking for loopholes … These restrictions are tough but they are there for a reason. If we don’t do this, Victorians will die. No round of golf or gym session with your mate is worth that ... Hang up your rods, leave the tinnie in the driveway, and clean your clubs at home."" That also means the state's annual and controversial month-long duck hunting season, which was due to start on May 2, is called off until the rules are reviewed again on May 11. The ACT confirmed it has also banned all outdoor recreation beyond exercise as non-essential. Over the border in NSW, hunting is out but fishing is allowed, under advice from police, so long as other physical distancing measures are followed. Tasmania and South Australia are allowing fishing, boating, and hunting – with the same proviso. WA is encouraging fishers and hunters to stay home, unless it's for essential food gathering. Some fishing and outdoor recreation is still allowed in the Northern Territory but access to remote communities, with vulnerable Indigenous populations, is restricted. On April 3, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""Doesn't matter what temperature it is, if it's a warm day, don't go in masses down to the beach."" The key word here is masses. No state has outlawed a trip to the beach (or the park). although some local councilcs have closed them, but they are urging people to reconsider whether the visit is necessary and warn new rules against gatherings may be enforced. Victoria also advises people to ""keep visits short and maintain physical distancing at all times"". A walk or a quick swim is OK, sunbaking probably not.  You can still hop in the car on your way to exercise but all states advise limiting travel. In Victoria, a government spokeswoman said on April 1, you should only drive in cars with people you live with, but advice since released says you can still use taxis and other ride-share services for ""permitted purposes"". WA advises sitting in the back if getting a taxi or an Uber and Tasmania also encourages people to extend physical distancing to car travel. ""Travelling in cars is not restricted ... non-essential travel is,"" a Tasmanian government spokeswoman said. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told ABC Radio people should not be going anywhere just for a drive, even if they had no intentions of getting out of the car. ""It is not a reasonable excuse,"" he said. ""If you don't really need to do it, then stay home and stay safe."" Not all states answered questions on whether learner drivers could still go out for driving practice but in Victoria, learner driving lessons should only be part of essential travel, such as to the supermarket.But NSW Police have ruled that learner driver lessons can continue – for an instructor it could be considered work that cannot be done from home and for the learner it is ""akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Family members can also take learners out for a lesson or for other essential travel. See more here. In all states, you can still visit someone in an emergency or to provide care – or even drop off supplies. But when it comes to social visits to households, it's the unnecessary guests that are now advised against, even if you live alone. Spending time together inside a house, as opposed to on a walk outside (1.5 metres apart), gives the virus more opportunities to spread in bathrooms and kitchens and around dinner tables. Victoria has taken one of the tougher lines on guests – banning all non-essential, social visits to homes even between relatives. Premier Daniel Andrews has spoken of a recent dinner party at which one person was infected with COVID-19 at the start but several guests had come down with the new illness by the end. In NSW, the position is similar. There are 16 excuses for leaving your home but none of them involve dinner parties, barbecues or beers with mates. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has stressed that extended families cannot get together, not even for holidays. In Queensland, social visits are allowed for up to two visitors to each household, although strangers can't visit. Tasmania and the ACT still also let you have up to two visitors as long as you are following social distancing measures – allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In WA, social visits are strongly discouraged but not banned outright. In South Australia and the Northern Territory, the limit of gatherings is enforced for 10 or more people not the national rule of two. In all states, child custody arrangements are unaffected and tradesman, cleaners, even removalists are allowed if you really need them (they may fall under essential work or caring) but physical distancing must be maintained. This was briefly a vexed issue in Victoria and NSW because social visits are otherwise banned. Victoria quickly backed down on its ""bonk ban"", after advising on April 1 that people should not visit or be intimate with partners they didn't live with. Within hours, it had made a specific exemption for romantic couples. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller came to the same conclusion by a different route: he said visiting a partner fell under the category of ""care"". ""Mental health,"" he said, ""we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you."" In the other states and territories, visitors can include partners. Unlike child custody, the rules around babysitting are less clear, although it again appears to fall under either care or work in most states. Victoria has since clarified its own rules to allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. But older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia’s chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit.  - with Noel Towell Sorry. Earlier this month Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians to stay at home this Easter, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"". All states have issued similiar advice, warning a migration to the coast or remote areas could spread the virus further and put dangerous strain on regional health resources. Planned holidays should be called off. But not all are fining people for ducking down to the holiday house.  Airbnb now have cancellation policies in place to get a full refund if you booked before March 14. NSW says people shouldn't go on holidays or use Airbnb unless it's for an essential reason such as work and police have revealed they were using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. Camping or setting up a caravan somewhere is out in Victoria. And while people can move between two homes if they have to, that doesn't include a short-term holiday rental. See more here.  In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, police have flagged they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. - with Stuart Layt, Tammy Mills, Michael Evans, Hannah Barry, Michael Fowler If you have to. You can even have removalists provided you adhere to physical distancing rules. The virus needs us to move; it jumps person to person after close contact so the idea is to slow its infection rate by temporarily changing our behaviour through physical distancing As the world waits for a vaccine, this will save lives by helping stop a surge of cases overwhelming emergency departments all at once. Along with measures such as lockdowns and tracing and isolating cases, social distancing has worked against outbreaks in the past, including the Spanish Flu of 1918. The recent surge in Australian cases has started to slow a little in recent days as new rules come into force. But if people do not follow them, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy warns that Australia could lose its window to contain the outbreak – and cases could rapidly explode. In some countries, including Australia, the virus's reproduction number - or the likely number of people each person will infect - has already fallen from its natural average of 2 to 3. If it keeps falling, to below one, the virus will start to die out on its own. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly says Australia is on the cusp of killing off the virus but the government has flagged pursuing full elimination of the virus (along the lines of the tough lockdowns seen in New Zealand) would be too costly. The federal government has stopped tracking recovery numbers in Australia, drawing criticism from some experts who say it is an important measure of any outbreak. Amid a shortage of testing kits, an Australian government spokesman confirmed only healthcare and aged care workers returning to the frontline must be ""cleared"" with testing (two negative tests) under the national guidelines. Local health authorities keep a close eye on all confirmed cases on the virus and others may still be retested. But most, such as those recovering in home isolation, only have to meet the following conditions: The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention advises the same 72-hour window of time after symptoms disappear but some studies overseas have shown the virus can live in the body for weeks after. The Australian government spokesman said ""a small proportion of people may have an illness that has completely resolved but their [tests] remain persistently positive"". There a decision on release from isolation will be made on a case-by-case basis after consulting their doctor, the testing lab and the public health unit. The 72-hour rule was decided by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which advises Health Minister Greg Hunt, as ""a precautionary period to manage uncertainty around how long a confirmed case remains infectious post-symptom resolution"", the spokesman said. ""Even in these patients there is uncertainty around whether there is a direct correlation of persistent [positive tests] and infectivity, but what we know from other virus infection, it is not a neat correlation,"" he said. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve."" Wash your hands after holding your cup. ""It's all about interrupting the chance of self-inoculation,"" says Associate Professor Ian Mackay, an expert on coronaviruses, at the University of Queensland. The virus has been found to last for shorter periods on card and paper than some other surfaces but it can persist, according to lab studies. ""Whether there is ever likely to be enough virus on that surface to infect another person remains an unanswered question,"" says Professor Mackay. ""The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus.""    Calculating the mortality rate of a pandemic that is still spreading is an imprecise science – people may be diagnosed or succumb to the illness further down the line. Based on the first 55,000-odd cases recorded in China, the WHO estimates the fatality rate so far as 3.4 per cent. But, given so many milder cases will go under the radar, most experts, including the WHO, agree the true number is likely closer to 1 per cent. That makes it deadlier than the flu but less dangerous than the other two rare coronaviruses to emerge in humans: SARS-CoV, which also caused global panic when it exploded onto the scene in late 2002, and MERS-CoV, which causes a condition more deadly again known as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). On the raw figures so far, more than two million people have been infected worldwide and at least 143,000 have died. About 500,000 have already ""officially"" recovered. The case of the Diamond Princess outbreak has offered one of the most stable data sets yet from which to make calculations- analysis of deaths and infections there put the overall fatality rate at just below 1 per cent. Data out of China found most people (about 80 per cent) recovered from the new virus on their own, even if they developed pneumonia. But about one in five needed more serious medical intervention (such as ventilation to help them breathe) and, of those, 6 per cent were pushed into critical care – as multiple organs began to fail along with the lungs, or septic shock (whole-body infection) set in. Anyone can catch the virus – but people most at risk of complications are older or have other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, making their bodies may be less able to cope with the extra strain. Smokers are also more likely to develop a nasty infection, as the virus breeds via cell receptors in the lungs known to increase with cigarette smoke. Experts say the higher the dose of virus you are hit with, the faster you will show symptoms and the more dangerous it can be for your immune system to fight off. For example, catching the virus from a doorknob is likely to give you a smaller dose than caring for an infected person without protective clothing such as a mask. For more on how the new virus affects the body and what it feels like to get it, you can read this explainer here. Difficulty breathing is the main reason that people with COVID-19 present to a hospital, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. The virus, which attacks the lungs, can progress quite quickly, worsening beyond shortness of breath. Once admitted to a ward and receiving oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but other people will need increasing amounts of support to keep their lungs sending oxygen throughout their body. ""That’s where intensive care would step in,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “If it’s bad enough that you need to be put on a breathing machine then you would definitely be in intensive care. If there was a sense that a patient was deteriorating towards needing a ventilator or a life-support machine, we’d also put them in intensive care. What intensive care is able to offer is the medical specialists and more monitoring … It's very intense – not surprisingly, given the name.” Without a drug that is definitively proven to halt or even slow COVID-19 at this stage, the aim is to support patients until they recover. “We wait for the virus to clear up and then the lungs will often repair themselves if we can wait and just support them while they do that. So you might have a period of, say, a week on a life-support machine where the virus starts to clear itself and the lungs start to improve and then we take the breathing machine away.” Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down. But, as experience has shown worldwide, the outcome is not always positive. “Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “They’re not using as much oxygen as they would normally. The problem with that is it works quite well and it’s a really effective therapy but, obviously, being in that state puts the body in quite a vulnerable position.” There are two problems that can arise, he says. One is that the infection itself can affect the other organs. And there is “just the stress of being so sick”. “We're supposed to be up and walking around but when you’re in intensive care your body is a little bit vulnerable to either getting another infection from bacteria, or the virus itself affecting your other organs. That’s why there is a difference, unfortunately, that people who are a little bit older or those a bit more vulnerable beforehand don’t do as well as people that are younger.” Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” So what would he say to younger people, including those aged 20-29 who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in NSW and Victoria more than any other age group? “Stay home. Do what the government’s asking us to do. Let’s do that for a week or a few months. You’re doing it potentially to protect yourself – it’s not impossible that young people get sick – but you’re really doing it to protect the older people in our community. To me, it’s a real social responsibility. It’s sort of a good test of Australians' ability to look after each other, really. You know, we all like to think we do that – but this is probably the chance to prove it.” Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a ventilator, whether they know it or not. It happens between the bit where you start to feel drowsy – ”you stop breathing and then I put in a breathing tube and put you on to a breathing machine,” says Dr Suzi Nou, president of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists – and the bit where you wake up in the recovery room. That breathing machine is a ventilator, pushing oxygen into your body. “For healthy patients undergoing routine surgery, [when] I stop giving them anaesthetic, they start breathing for themselves,” says Dr Nou. Treating patients with COVID-19, whose lungs are compromised by the disease, is another story. “They’re too unwell to do the job of breathing for themselves. We’d induce the state of sleepiness, put a breathing tube in and put them on the ventilator.” While a patient having routine surgery will rely on a ventilator for minutes or hours – and it’s not uncommon for a patient in intensive care to rely on one for four or five days – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. This is why ventilators have become such a precious commodity worldwide since the pandemic took hold, prompting a doctor in the hard-hit Italian region of Lombardy to say they had become as precious as gold. There are plans for the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to be doubled to 4000 while more have been freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery and still more are now being manufactured in Australia.   But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou and highly trained nurses. In Australia, every patient on a ventilator has a dedicated nurse. It's these professionals who need to be supported to keep coming to work in the coming weeks and months, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Symptoms tend to clear up in just a week or two in mild cases or three to six for more serious, according to WHO data. But early evidence suggests the virus can stick around in the body even longer in some cases. Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. Experts say it’s too early to say if this illness will result in permanent damage, such as the lung tissue scarring seen in more severe SARS and MERS patients. The federal government is urging those aged 70 or over (as well as those with a chronic condition over the age of 60 or Indigenous people over 50) to stay home ""where practicable"", avoiding contact with others as much as they can, including family such as grandchildren. If you fall into these categories, this measure is designed to protect you, not keep you a prisoner at home. You can still go outside or shop if absolutely necessary but it is best to opt for delivery or seek help from family, friends or even the local council to get supplies. Visits to aged-care homes have also been restricted to protect vulnerable elderly residents. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says Australians weighing up whether to bring elderly relatives home to care for them now face a difficult ""trade-off"". On the one hand, Professor Kelly says ""the most frail, elderly people requiring, for example, a lot of home care ... may be best to shelter with relatives"". But if other family members are going ""out into the world ... and interacting with others"", they risk bringing the virus into the home. The answer isn't always clear-cut and will come down to personal circumstances. While the elderly and those with underlying conditions are more likely to die from COVID-19, young people can too. Figures from China, Europe and the US show concerningly high hospitalisation rates among the under 60s and in Australia there are people under 50 already in need of intensive care. And note this: there have now been more coronavirus cases in both NSW and Victoria among 25- to 29 year-olds than any other age group. In any case, even if you're young and get a milder case you can still spread the virus to someone who might not be so lucky. Aren't you the optimist? The new rules spell the end of the backyard barbecue or the extended family dinner – at least for now. House parties might even become an offence in some states. But experts say these tough temporary measures reflect just how easily the virus can spread. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has warned of a dinner party where one person was infected with COVID-19 – at the start of the night. ""By the end of the dinner party, almost everybody [there] had the coronavirus – this spreads rapidly,"" he said. Children on school holidays should not have friends over nor hang around shopping centres together, Mr Andrews has said, and it's not a case of moving beers at the pub to the living room. “We cannot have people queuing for intensive care beds. That will mean they will die. We’ve got to buy time.” The first NSW COVID-19 cases were reported in Burwood, Parramatta, Randwick and Ku-Ring-Gai in late January. Clusters of cases began appearing in Ryde, Parramatta, Hornsby and central Sydney in mid-March. The virus began to spread outside Sydney on March 5, with early cases in Goulburn, the Mid-Coast and Orange. It has since spread up and down the state's east coast and in regional areas inland. By the end of March, the biggest clusters – in Waverley, the Northern Beaches and Sydney – had more than 100 cases each. More than 100 cases were linked to three cruise ships, including the Ruby Princess, which docked at Circular Quay in late March. On April 1, a pop-up testing clinic opened in Bondi, in the local government area of Waverley, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest number of those with an unknown source of infection. In Victoria, about four in five confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Greater Melbourne area, but COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the state. At the start of April, at least one resident had been diagnosed in 68 of the state's 79 municipalities. So far, the areas with the highest numbers of cases have been among the most affluent parts of Melbourne. A woman infected with COVID-19 on a ski holiday in the US attended a 21st birthday party in wealthy inner-east Malvern, and at least six guests contracted the virus. On April 1, the Stonnington local government area, which encompasses Malvern, had the highest number of confirmed cases with 77. In recent days there have been cases among retail workers, such as a Coles and K-Mart outlet in Melbourne's east. Hospitals have also been the site of smaller clusters and, as it stands at the moment, about 10 per cent of Victoria's confirmed coronavirus diagnoses have been in healthcare workers. Viruses need hosts to survive – they can't make it on their own. So far, the best evidence we have on how long the virus lasts on surfaces comes from a letter to the editor by a team of American scientists published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world’s top medical journals. The data is still early stage and needs to be interpreted with caution. They placed samples of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic, stainless steel, cardboard and copper and tracked what happened to the virus. The virus was the most stable on plastic and stainless steel and could be detected up to 72 hours later. On absorbent surfaces such as cardboard, fabric or paper it degrades much faster. However, the amount of the virus fell quickly over time. On plastic, for example, it halved in about seven hours. That indicates these surfaces do not remain infectious forever. The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus. Copper has broad anti-microbial properties and has been installed in some hospitals around the world to stop the spread of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. When a bacterium or virus lands on copper, electrically charged particles known as ions jump from the surface into the bacterium, punching holes in it and killing it. Some scientists have suggested that copper doorplates and doorknobs be installed in healthcare facilities and public places in Australia. It is possible, although unlikely, exchanging cash could transmit the virus. Using a card is “probably lower risk”, write Professor Ian Mackay and Dr Katherine Arden on The Conversation, because you keep the card and don’t have to touch other people. In fact, using ""tap and pay"" is a social distancing practice recommended by the federal government. - with Liam Mannix You can still order in food but authorities say you shouldn't let the courier into your home and, if in an apartment, you should pick up the order outside rather than inviting them through a security door into a communal area. Professor Doherty says that while food delivery is unlikely to be a major source of infection, it's something to keep in mind when you're ""taking hold of the pizza box"". ""Before you take the food out, wash your hands and then put the pizza box somewhere out of the way,"" Professor Doherty suggests in a webinar for the Australian Academy of Science. “It can certainly survive longer on plastics and steel ... in the SARS epidemic, of course, we saw people wiping down elevator buttons. […] Just open everything, wash your hands before you take the food out of the plastic and maybe transfer it to another plastic bag before you put it in the fridge."" No. The Centre for Food Safety’s guidelines say there is no evidence the virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed on via food. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention agrees. Food should be washed with water before you eat it. Soap or dishwashing liquid should not be used, as they can stay on food and cause sickness. There is no need to wash food you are going to cook, as the heat will kill the virus, says Arden. You also don’t need to scrub food that you are going to later peel, such as oranges. Touching produce and then touching your face is more relevant. “Think of your hands as the enemy,” write Professor Ian Mackay and virologist Katherine Arden. If the virus comes into contact with your hands, and then you touch your nose, mouth or eyes, it can gain entry to your body. You must wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly before eating. - Liam Mannix We don’t need to be worried about the temperature of a wash because we use strong detergents in our washing powders, even when they are cold wash formulations, says virologist Katherine Ardern and coronavirus expert Associate Professor Ian Mackay, both at the University of Queensland. They cite a recent study, which, although not having yet been through a peer review process so not conclusive, provides an early picture of how the virus reacts in certain conditions. In a laboratory, a 30-minute incubation of the virus at 56C or a five-minute incubation at 70C rendered SARS-CoV-2 inactive. In its recommendations for households where someone is ill, or suspected of being ill with COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends laundering items ""using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items"", and drying the items completely. A similar answer applies as with washing machines. Professor Mackay notes that if you are caring for an ill person, you need to be extra vigilant in cleaning their crockery and cutlery to ensure that you limit the risk of family spread. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this if someone has COVID-19 in your household: ""The ill person should eat/be fed in their room if possible. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Clean hands after handling used food service items."" The NSW Health Department advises using common household disinfectant sprays for surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 is what is known as an “enveloped virus”, which means it is made of a little ball of fat and protein. That makes it relatively easily to kill with standard disinfectants. In Australia, disinfectants are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, so if you pick the right one – look for a specific disinfectant, not a cleaner – you can be confident it works. Not all disinfectants are regulated by the same standards. Look for a specific label on the disinfectant that means it kills viruses, such as virucidal or antiviral activity. Importantly, this is different to antibacterial – antibacterial ingredients kill bacteria, not viruses. Make sure you follow the instructions on the label, which may include cleaning a surface before disinfecting it. Cleaning and disinfecting are different things. As the CDC notes, cleaning does not kill germs in itself but, by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. The Australian Department of Health advises you to target frequently touched surfaces: door handles, bed rails, table tops and light switches. As with all things COVID-19, there is still much we don’t know. The advice above is based on guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guidance from the Australian Department of Health, from the Australian Research Council Training Centre for Food Safety, and expert commentary from Associate Professor Ian Mackay (an expert on coronaviruses) and Katherine Ardern (a virologist), both at the University of Queensland. – Liam Mannix One of the big mysteries of the virus is how infectious asymptomatic people really are. Some experts say people shed the most virus when they are unwell, especially while coughing, and the WHO calculates a danger window of infectivity about 48 hours before symptoms first appear. But other studies have tracked infections in parts of China and Singapore to “stealth” transmitters with mild or no symptoms. This also played out in the case of the cruise ship turned floating quarantine site the Diamond Princess in early February. A study found that 18 per cent of those infected on board never showed symptoms. Because this virus can spread before symptoms appear, it is especially hard to contain. ""Let's stop saying it's a bad flu,"" pleaded doctor Daniele Macchini, from the northern Italian city of Bergamo, where the virus had gained a deadly foothold. Patients inundating intensive care wards had ""far from the complications of a flu"", the doctor wrote on Facebook in March. While flu has many of the same symptoms and results in tens of thousands of deaths worldwide every year, COVID-19 is more than 10 times deadlier. In Australia, government figures for the most recent flu season ending October 2019 show 812 people died of influenza out of 298,120 reported cases – a fatality rate of about 0.27 per cent. Emerging coronaviruses such as this strain and SARS can also do more damage to the body, particularly the lungs. And the new virus is more infectious than the flu, or SARS or MERS, with one COVID-19 patient likely to infect between two and three others. Yes, it's possible. As it breeds in the lungs, the virus can impair your body's ability to filter out germs falling down from the upper airways and so leave some people susceptible to another bug – whether the common cold, influenza or a case of bacterial pneumonia. So this year there is a particular urgency behind calls for people to have their flu shots, as hospitals brace for a surge of COVID-19 and flu cases hitting all at once. On April 1, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly urged Australians, especially those aged over 65, to get their flu vaccines as soon as possible. ""As of now there are millions of vaccines out there ready,"" Professor Kelly said. That's the big question. This virus's closest relative, SARS, while deadly, spread more slowly and to far fewer countries and so early containment efforts worked to wipe it out, largely within a year. For COVID-19, many experts are instead drawing parallels with the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed millions around the world because it spread so far. The good news is medicine has taken a quantum leap forward since then. Still, modelling by the Imperial College London suggests countries will need to use control measures such as social distancing, aggressive case detection, even shutdowns right through until a vaccine becomes available – between 12 and 18 months. The virus has now reached most of the world – more than 180 countries, and the World Health Organisation warns it is ""accelerating"". It took the virus 67 days to infect the first 100,000 people, just 11 to reach 200,000 and four to top 300,000. By mid-March in Australia, the number of cases was doubling every three to four days. In recent days, since stricter social distancing rules came into force and more people start to stay home, that growth has slowed but authorities say now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"". Outside China, major clusters of the virus have broken out in Italy, where hospitals have been pushed to the brink as well as the US, Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea. Some nations, including many in Europe, have turned to the ""China model"" of forced home quarantines and transport shutdowns to stop the virus. But experts note that China, as well as countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, have also started to ""flatten their curve"" of infection growth through exhaustive testing, contact tracing of known cases and community take-up of ""social distancing"" measures such as working from home or taking schools online. China's success so far means it is already starting to relax many of its lockdowns, even as it braces for a potential second wave. In Italy and now other countries such as Spain, France and the UK, people are only allowed to leave their homes to run essential errands such as grabbing groceries (and they must queue 1.5 metres apart).  The main symptoms of the new coronavirus are: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat. Nausea or diarrhea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS, and a blocked nose is less common again. The federal government has ruled people shouldn’t gather together except for “essential” activities such as school, public transport and work – but working from home is strongly encouraged and schools will move to mostly online lessons after Easter, except for students who have to attend in person. Shopping centres will stay open but food courts will be for takeaway only. People are urged to just buy what they need and not collect together or take time browsing. Those indoor gatherings still running should allow space for one person per four square metres. While the government is yet to move towards a full-scale shutdown of all but non-essential services, the following have already closed or suspended: The good news is the other thing shutting down is evictions – with a moratorium on evictions from commercial and residential rental properties as a “result of financial distress"" for the next six months. Services so far considered ""essential"" under a wider shutdown include pharmacies, fuel stations, health care, food shops and public transport and airports. Hairdressers and barbers are not on that list but can remain open for now – though they must strictly manage social distancing and the four-square-metre rule. The federal government says hotels, hostels, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be a decision for each state and territory. All non-urgent elective surgeries are postponed until further notice. Federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has written to states and territories urging them to exempt telcos, postal services and media organisations from any future restrictions on movement as ""essential services"". Weddings are limited to five people – the couple, the celebrant and the witnesses – and funerals must be capped at 10 people, in what the government has called ""very difficult"" but necessary measures. JobSeeker is a payment of $550 a fortnight (now increased to $1100 a fortnight as part of a coronavirus stimulus boost) for those who have lost their employment. JobSeeker replaced the NewStart allowance in March. However, the new JobKeeper scheme is a $1500 payment (before tax) per staff member provided to employers by the government over the next six months to help businesses hold onto workers so that after the pandemic is over they can more easily start over. Employers can only receive the subsidy if they have turnover of less than $1 billion and this figure has fallen by 30 per cent or more, or they have a turnover higher than $1 billion and this has fallen by 50 per cent or more. Employers receiving the subsidy must report to the Australian Tax Office every month. See here for details. – Jennifer Duke At least one in 10 Australians have asthma but the condition doesn’t mean you’re more likely to catch COVID-19. The problem is that because your lungs are already inflamed, it can leave you open to a more severe case or trigger an asthma attack. “It’s a double-whammy, really,” says National Asthma Council Australia chief Siobhan Brophy. Respiratory physician Peter Wark says there’s not enough data yet to know exactly how COVID-19 affects asthmatics but, from previous experience with other respiratory illnesses, they’ll likely be at higher risk of complications – as was observed during the SARS outbreak and still occurs with common illnesses such as cold and flu. The WHO and other health authorities are urging extra precautions for asthmatics. Brophy says now is the time to be on your “best behaviour”: following your asthma plan and doctor’s advice to the letter and re-filling prescriptions so your lungs are in their best shape possible should an infection come. While people without the condition have been hoarding ventolin, she notes there’s little point as the medication is designed to treat an asthma attack and not COVID-19. There has been some concern about continuing asthma medication such as steroid tablets or injections, which could suppress the body's overall immune system, Brophy says, but steroid inhalers are still fine – they only travel to the lungs and remain vital for asthmatics. “Talk to your doctor before you stop taking anything but if you’re still using an old nebuliser to take your medication, use a puffer and a spacer instead. A nebuliser will spray out particles [and possibly germs] from your lungs."" Tell your doctor about your asthma and your medication if you develop symptoms. Replay   Coronaviruses are a family of viruses causing respiratory illness mostly found in animals. Only seven have been identified in humans, including the four that commonly give us coughs and colds. But when a new strain jumps across from wildlife, such as SARS and now this new strain, it can be dangerous as there is no natural immunity to fight it off. Because it's new, at first the virus was known simply as the ""novel"" coronavirus. Then the WHO named it SARS-CoV-2, given it shares so much of its DNA – about 75 per cent – with the SARS-CoV strain behind the SARS outbreak. The illness caused by this current strain is now called COVID-19. The illness was first identified after people started falling ill at wet market reported to sell wild animals in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unfounded theories that the virus is man-made quickly began to circulate online but scientists studying its genome already agree it came from animals - as more than 70 per cent of all new diseases emerging in humans do. Wild animals packed together and then butchered in live markets throughout Asia can be incubators for viruses to evolve and jump species barriers – SARS was traced back to a colony of bats but was believed to have passed into humans again in a wet market via the Himalayan palm civet, an ancient species of mammal eaten as a delicacy in China. And MERS also has bat origins but mostly spreads from infected camels, often in slaughterhouses. Bats are essential to many ecosystems we rely on but, through a lucky quirk in their immune system, they also carry a whole host of diseases that do not harm them. Early work suggests this new virus is 96 per cent similar to a SARS-like strain already discovered in bats a few years back, but experts think it likely first jumped into another animal, possibly the highly endangered and heavily trafficked pangolin, where it gained potency before passing into humans. The question of who should practice this social distancing (everyone) versus who should seal themselves off completely has sparked some confusion. To stem the spread of COVID-19, millions of people infected or exposed around the world are also being urged to go into voluntary exile at home or in isolation wards. While some people have chosen to start home isolation themselves, thousands of others in Australia been already been issued formal notices to comply as states call in police to help enforce them. We dive into the rules in this explainer here but in brief: if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or have returned from overseas, then you must self-isolate for a full fortnight (the estimated period of virus incubation before symptoms appear). If you are self-isolating at home, your household can still go out but you should try to keep to yourself, wearing a mask around others, ordering in food rather than going out, disinfecting common areas and keeping a close eye on how you are feeling (symptoms to watch out for are a high fever and shortness of breath). If you are infected yourself or awaiting tests, then everyone should stay home. You can still wander into your garden or balcony but, while some officials have said you can walk the dog or stretch your legs, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says you must stay home if you've been told to self-isolate: ""Sorry."" Despite these rules, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said, on March 27, that Australia was still seeing large numbers of returned travellers with the virus and, in many cases, passing it on to their families. “More than two-thirds are returned travellers, and a significant proportion of the other cases have been transmitted from returned travellers,” he said. From March 29, all overseas arrivals are being escorted from airports into hotels and other accommodation for the 14-day window, at the government's expense. The army has been called in alongside police to enforce these quarantines after a number of people were caught out of their homes breaking isolation orders. Only if you really have to. Our borders have closed and overseas travel is now banned under biosecurity powers, except in exceptional circumstances. Citizens still travelling abroad are urged to come home as countries impose similar shutdowns of their own. Starting with Tasmania, most states have also started to close their domestic borders - police patrols will now ask people crossing over to go into quarantine for the recommended 14-day window. At this early stage, we are still not absolutely sure how the virus affects women and babies. Different governments have offered different advice.For now, let’s stick to what Australia’s peak body, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZOG), has to say. Note these guidelines are changing regularly and you should check back on their website for the most up-to-date advice. According to guidelines, at this stage it does not appear that pregnant women are at greater risk from COVID-19 than the rest of the population - like they were during the world's last pandemic Swine Flu in 2009. However, they tend to be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses in general, such as the flu. There is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or birth abnormalities, nor is there evidence the virus can pass from woman to unborn child or via breastmilk. “The safest place to birth your baby is in a hospital, where you have access to highly trained staff and emergency facilities,” the guidelines state. If the mother is infected at the time of birth, she should not be separated from her newborn, but should wear a mask and take precautions. The health advice is the same for pregnant women as it is for everyone else: work from home, avoid public places, and nail your hand hygiene. The RANZCOG guidelines suggest visitors in hospital are limited only to the immediate partner. But this is just a suggestion – different hospitals will have different rules. No. Public transport is still running as it is considered one of the essential activities exempt from the government's ban on gatherings but cleaning has been ramped up. While calls are growing from some experts to shut down public transport already, many people rely on it. Still, as social distancing rules come into force, travellers are deserting normally packed routes in droves. When on public transport, health officials say you should allow room for others as much as possible, rather than crowding in. It's also important to keep an eye on what you've been touching. If you then touch your face, a virus surviving on, say, a metal handrail could jump across – so carry a disinfectant or even wear one (stylish) glove for holding on and touching things. The most hopeful estimates fall within the range of 12 to 18 months. A report for the British government put it at “potentially 18 months or more”. Why? Because making a vaccine is really, really hard. To make a vaccine, you first need to design a way of giving a human immunity against a virus. Then you need to make sure the vaccine is not toxic. Then you need to test it in animals. Then you need to test it in humans – and the tests need to be large so we can make sure it works and is safe. And then you need to make the billions of doses needed. And there is every chance a vaccine that looks promising in the lab, or in animal tests, won’t work in humans. Experts are hoping to roll out a safe vaccine within 18 months. But even that would be unprecedented. No vaccine has ever been developed that quickly. - Liam Mannix, science reporter The Peter Doherty Institute in Australia is working on both a vaccine and a potential therapeutic treatment for the virus, and director Sharon Lewin says the latter might offer a faster fix. A drug that could block the virus from replicating in the body (or calm down the body's intense immune response to it) could keep patients with severe infections alive and, in the case of an antiviral, reduce transmission. Several existing drugs are now being trialled against the new virus worldwide, including those used to treat HIV, malaria, and arthritis. The results look promising but it's not time to rush out to the pharmacy just yet. It took this new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first thousand people. By contrast, SARS took 130 days and the less infectious MERS more than two years to infect a thousand people after it emerged in 2012. When SARS finished its spread after nine months in 2003, only 8098 cases had been confirmed across 26 countries but close to 10 per cent of those were fatal. (Most clusters happened in hospitals or households.) MERS has been circulating for eight years across 27 countries so far, and kills about a third of those who fall ill – out of about 2500 confirmed cases. Ebola is even more deadly, killing more than 40 per cent of those diagnosed over a number of outbreaks since the 1970s but it has been reported in just a handful of countries. In the pandemic records, the infamous 1918 Spanish flu killed about 2.5 per cent of its victims over two years – but because it infected so many people (close to 27 per cent of the world's population) at a time of much cruder medical care, about 50 million died. Today, doctors are much better able to stave off secondary bacterial infections, which proved particularly deadly during that outbreak. And, unlike the Spanish flu, young people are not dying at the same high rates. The last pandemic was swine flu in 2009, the second coming of a H1N1 influenza that infected between 11 and 21 per cent of the world's population. Governments mounted costly responses until it was ruled to be over in October 2010. But the virus killed about 285,000 people (fewer than seasonal flu normally does) with a relatively low fatality rate of .02 per cent, and the WHO copped criticism for labelling it a pandemic at all.

He has a valuable story to tell the world about Australia’s response to the coronavirus. The Morrison model of shared power between the Commonwealth government and the states and territories has proven to be more efficient in a health crisis than the wartime approach where a single politician or expert assumes the burden of national saviour. The international media has missed this scoop.

The irony is that second item suddenly threatens to alienate Morrison from his macho peers in Europe. This week, the governments of Britain and France politely brushed off the Prime Minister’s call for an international inquiry into the pandemic. Now was not the time to discuss it, they said. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that their focus was on saving lives. A spokesman French President Emmanuel Macron reminded Morrison that there should be ""transparency for all players"" not just the World Health Organisation. For Morrison, these gentle diplomatic rebukes serve as a warning, once again, of the dangers of getting ahead of himself. He remains a work in progress as prime minister; a shifting mix of insight, empathy, stubborn partisanship and policy flightiness. The national cabinet is his once-in-a-generation innovation. It has allowed the individual states to tailor their policy responses to local needs, and released both sides of politics from the shackles of tribalism. The incentive for co-operation between leaders overwhelms any urge to appease their respective bases. Morrison and the Liberal premiers can safely ignore the attention seekers and extremists on their respective backbenches, while Labor premiers and chief ministers can do the same with their public sector unions. The shock jocks and contrarians have been reduced to spectators for now. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  The critical difference the national cabinet makes is in the effective power it grants the states and territories to push back against bad policy. Morrison might not have appreciated it at the time, but Daniel Andrews, the Victorian Labor Premier, and Gladys Berejiklian, the NSW Liberal Premier, did him a favour when they forced his hand to lock down the economy just over a month ago. If he had assumed the responsibility for himself, and waited a few more days, or even a week, it might have been too late to contain the virus. The contest of ideas is partly a happy accident of the federation. Ordinarily, the Commonwealth can bully the states and territories with its financial powers. It can either buy the outcome it wants, or secure it via the stick of funding cuts. But the states and territory bring three weapons to the table in this crisis. They have direct control over hospitals, schools and the police. With command on the frontline, they have the incentive to stand up to the Commonwealth. It recreates the dynamic of the old Bob Hawke cabinets, when ministers were free to run their portfolios, and the prime minister didn’t try to micromanage the government from his office. Yet Morrison continues to test the unity, and purpose, of the national cabinet with his penchant for speaking before consulting. Last week’s clash over when schools should reopen placed teachers and parents in the impossible situation of not knowing who was in charge. Do they listen to the Prime Minister, or their premier? The question answered itself once the premiers pushed back. The national cabinet proved its worth, once again, because it protected Morrison from the pratfall of governing alone. It gave the premiers a forum to vent without making it personal, and provided Morrison with the room to publicly back down without losing face. This week, the British and the French leaders played a version of the same game. They pulled rank without humiliating Morrison, saving the Prime Minister from his own impatience. Australia’s call to reform the WHO jumped one obvious step: the pandemic is not under control. Asking allies to think ahead to a new world order, and without ringing ahead to test the idea, was naive, if not downright presumptuous. Morrison has to establish two things before he can earn the right to heard by the rest of the world. He has to suppress the virus at home, and then be willing to speak truth to both superpowers, Washington and Beijing. It does not seem to have occurred to the Prime Minister that European leaders might be furious with the American President’s decision to withdraw funding from the WHO. Or that Australia’s call for reform of the organisation would be seen as the unhelpful reflex of an unquestioning ally. Macron’s emphasis on ""all players"" was deliberate. When the time does come for an investigation into the pandemic – its origin, its spread and the WHO’s response – the United States will deserve a fair share of the scrutiny. China can’t be expected to cooperate unless the US is mentioned in the same sentence. Morrison couldn’t bring himself to do it this week. If he really wants to command the international stage, it must be as an honest broker. Which brings up another topic Morrison may have pushed out of his mind, but which Europe has not forgotten. Does Australia intend to take climate change seriously once the crisis passes? Or will Morrison revert to his defensive, divisive self of last summer, when his response to Australia’s bushfire crisis made him a figure of global ridicule. Recall the assessment of the Financial Times, in an editorial published two days before Christmas last year: ""Beyond Australia’s shores, his government stands as a reproach to any leaders tempted to follow its lamentable response to the deepening threat of climate change."" If Morrison wants the world to listen to Australia, he can’t pick and choose between evidence-based policy, and vested interest. But first Morrison must consolidate the gains on the homefront. Suppression of the virus is within reach. But the risk of an outbreak can’t be discounted. Singapore, one of the countries lauded as an early role model, has seen its caseload soar in recent days. Even the most obsessively clean society is not immune. Australia can’t afford to gloat, because we don’t know what part of our success is due to the luck of geography. The pandemic took off in the northern hemisphere’s winter. Our winter is still coming, but this is the time when some controls are expected to be eased. Language will be important as parts of the economy are reopened. Morrison is prone to waffle. His press conferences begin with a stream of consciousness; impressive in their command of detail, but distracting in their imprecision. Cliches, and platitudes are plucked seemingly at random, and it is easy to lose the thread of his argument.

He has a valuable story to tell the world about Australia’s response to the coronavirus.

11,/business/companies/the-week-that-virgin-australia-hit-the-ground-hard-20200423-p54mhp.html,The week that Virgin Australia hit the ground hard,"It was getting close to 8pm on Thursday night when Paul Scurrah finally accepted the airline he leads was unlikely to avoid financial collapse.  The Virgin Australia chief executive was attending a virtual meeting inside the makeshift office in his Brisbane home when bad news filtered through from Canberra. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had used a television interview to declare a fix to the airline's woes was at hand. It was not the type of solution Scurrah had been holding out for. Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah after announcing the company had gone into administration on Tuesday.Credit:Louise Kennerley Morrison said his government would not get in the way of a ""commercial solution"" to save Australia's second airline as it teetered on the brink of collapse. ""And there are many things going on there,” the Prime Minister said. It was the first time the Virgin camp had heard of a fix that did not involve at least some taxpayers' cash. The interview was a clear message that after weeks of back and forth, any hope of government support was shot. Australia's second airline went into voluntary administration on Monday, a move that adds to the uncertainty for its 10,000 employees, many of whom have been stood down during the coronavirus pandemic, and could change the face of aviation in this country.  The government's decision to let Virgin slide into administration has set off a multibillion-dollar race for control of the airline involving some of the nation's most powerful dealmakers and deepest-pocketed investors. It has already pitted state governments against each other. BGH Capital, the private equity firm led by well-connected dealmakers Ben Gray and Robin Bishop is the highest-profile investment firm in the race.  Transport billionaire and airport owner Linsday Fox is also eyeing the airline, along with various international investors. Yet while many potential buyers are circling Virgin, the government's decision is not without political risk. Administration, a mechanism designed to allow a company to survive while also clawing back money for lenders, can be messy, as other high-profile corporate implosions such as Network Ten show. The appointment of former Macquarie chief Nicholas Moore as an emissary for Morrison in the proceedings suggests the government is well aware of this and that it may end up being the buyer of last resort anyway. Morrison had repeatedly signalled in recent weeks that there would be no Virgin bailout. The government did not want to set a precedent that would prompt other challenged companies to seek assistance. Nor did it like the politics of being seen to support Virgin's foreign shareholders, which include aviation giants Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. But the Prime Minister's announcement on Thursday still came as a shock to those at Virgin who had been hanging on to hopes of support. A clip of the comment was quickly sent around to Scurrah and other senior managers, sparking a flurry of messages and phone calls. Replay   Virgin's management, board and bankers been working feverishly to restructure the group, weighed down with $6.8 billion in debt, so it could survive the coronavirus pandemic. Sources close to the survival project run by investment banks Houlihan Lokey and UBS and reporting to chairman Elizabeth Bryan say Virgin had attracted nine different parties who were looking at deals to keep the airline alive. However all of the proposals hinged on some level of government support. Scurrah, in the job for only 13 months, first wrote to Morrison on March 26 asking him for ""urgent support"" in the form of a $1.4 billion loan facility. Knocked back, the long-time transport and logistics executive returned with eight further proposals, the final one being for just $200 million he was convinced would buy Virgin enough time to finalise a solvent restructuring deal. Some observers believe Team Virgin should have realised its proposals were going nowhere. ""If you tell even a small child they can't have any chocolate seven times you have to question their intelligence when they come back again,"" said one senior banker. Still, despite the government signalling early on it would not provide financial support to specific companies, the Virgin camp believed there were encouraging signs and held out hope. But the switch in rhetoric from considering ""all options"" to ensure Australia retained two airlines (albeit with an assurance taxpayers would not ""bail out"" Virgin's foreign owners), to there being a ""commercial solution"" signalled that was over. Sources who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters said that in later talks, Morrison's office encouraged Virgin to talk to BGH. There is also a view within the Virgin camp that BGH's interest gave the government confidence it did not need to come to its assistance. “BGH came to Virgin through the government,” said one source with knowledge of the events. ""They’re very close to the government and were very clear and aggressive and saying: 'you don’t need to do anything, we’ll pick it up'."" The firm had sniffed around Virgin weeks earlier and had spoken to key figures at the airline including Scurrah and Bryan. But the two camps were at loggerheads about how the deal would be structured financially. One critic of Virgin, speaking on condition of anonymity, says the airline should have engaged more enthusiastically with BGH and other private suitors earlier. ""People were told to structure bids in a way that assumed [Virgin's] balance sheet was OK when it clearly wasn't,"" he said. ""The company is losing hundreds of millions of dollars."" Others question the view BGH had any influence over the government's decision and describe Virgin's reaction as ""sour grapes"". They argue there was no chance Morrison would open the floodgates to other bailouts by helping the airline. They also point out the only party that clearly put pressure on the government was rival Qantas, whose chief executive Alan Joyce has said Virgin should not be rewarded for years of mismanagement. Qantas had also asked the government to proportionally match any support it gave Virgin to ""even the playing field"". At 2.15am on Sunday morning BGH signed confidentiality agreements with Virgin, giving the buyout firm access to its data room to inspect its books. BGH has $2.6 billion in it coffers and is working with heavy-hitting Melbourne lawyer Leon Zwier and outgoing PwC boss Luke Sayers. It is also backed by the nation's largest super fund, AustralianSuper, which manages $180 billion in retirement savings and is linked to the trade union movement. Former ACTU director Dave Oliver is a director. The BGH consortium is one of 11 groups Virgin's administrators say are interested in buying and relaunching the airline. Deloitte partner and Virgin administrator Vaughan Strawbridge hopes to find a new owner within three months. Buyout firms Bain Capital, Apollo and Oaktree are also said to be interested. So is US airline investor Indigo Partners, which owns a number of budget airlines across the Americas and Europe, including Frontier Airlines and Wizz Air, and which Virgin has approached in the past about becoming an investor, according to a source with knowledge of those conversations. State governments could also play a role in determining Virgin's future, with Queensland putting $200 million on the table and declaring it will ""stop at nothing"" to keep the airline in Brisbane, and NSW and Victoria expressing an interest in luring it south. Linsday Fox, who is close to Sayers, discussed a plan to bring Virgin to his privately-owned Avalon airport with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. Virgin first opened its data room three weeks ago so its major shareholders could consider recapitalising the business. The only one who came close was co-founder and 10 per cent shareholder Richard Branson. Observers note he had the most to lose from Virgin's collapse: the licence fees he gets for the Virgin brand, suggested to be worth around $15 million to $25 million a year. At a board meeting on Monday, Virgin's directors made the unenviable decision to appoint Deloitte as administrators. That firm was chosen a little over two weeks earlier at another meeting where there was mild disagreement about which group was best to advise the ailing airline. Sources aware of the selection process said the board of Virgin favoured KordaMentha, given its success with administrations with large unionised workforces, while Scurrah favoured  PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Unable to make a decision, they threw to CFO Keith Neate, who went for  Deloitte. Many in the Virgin camp are riled by the Morrison government's mantra that it did not want to bail out Virgin's foreign shareholders. They say every deal they put forward involved these shareholders being wiped out by an injection of new equity. Their backs are also up over how much money the government has given to Regional Express Airlines, believing the mostly foreign-owned company chaired by former Nationals leader John Sharp has received the lion's share of almost $300 million in assistance to the regional aviation industry. “If Virgin had been given that and a government guarantee, it may well have been able to do a solvent restructuring,” said one figure close to the events. Transport Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack's assistance package of $715 million in waived fees and levies for Virgin and Qantas appears to have made little impact at a time when they are barely flying. Virgin sources said it received the first $4 million cash injection from the program on Friday. At the same time, some investment banking sources (who declined to be named to maintain business relationships) were surprised that Virgin appeared to only be considering a rescue deal that included the government or administration and did not consider a debt-for-equity swap to rescue the company outside of administration, a mechanism used by Nine Entertainment and Slater & Gordon in the past. ""I couldn't even get them to return my call,"" said one senior investment banker. Many industry watchers now see administration as a chance for the loss-making Virgin to improve its business by ripping up bad contracts and shaking off unsustainable debts. But forces at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Morrison government could play a key role in determining whether that happens. Federal Labor and unions wanted the government to bail Virgin out to protect jobs and save the nation from a potential Qantas monopoly. Governments in America and across Europe have already extended billions of dollars in financial aid to their airlines as the pandemic forced them to ground operations. The Australian Council of Trade Unions will arrange representation for Virgin's 10,000 workers, who are owed $450 million in wages, leave and other entitlements. This could make them a decisive voting bloc when it comes to any rescue deal. ACTU president Michele O'Neil said the peak union body would support deals that were in the best interests of workers - which meant saving as many jobs as possible in a relaunched airline. The unions would support ""a buyer that has a viable plan for the long-term future for Virgin airlines, not a short term take-the-money-and-run proposal,"" she said. Meanwhile the holders of Virgin's $1.8 billion of junk bonds are concerned they will be asked to take a much larger haircut on what they are owed than Virgin's secured creditors - banks and aircraft lessors - and say they are ""up for a fight"". “This is not going to be as simple as everyone’s saying, and done and dusted in two or three weeks,"" said one investment banker.

The Australian Council of Trade Unions will arrange representation for Virgin's 10,000 workers, who are owed $450 million in wages, leave and other entitlements. This could make them a decisive voting bloc when it comes to any rescue deal. ACTU president Michele O'Neil said the peak union body would support deals that were in the best interests of workers - which meant saving as many jobs as possible in a relaunched airline. The unions would support ""a buyer that has a viable plan for the long-term future for Virgin airlines, not a short term take-the-money-and-run proposal,"" she said. Meanwhile the holders of Virgin's $1.8 billion of junk bonds are concerned they will be asked to take a much larger haircut on what they are owed than Virgin's secured creditors - banks and aircraft lessors - and say they are ""up for a fight"". “This is not going to be as simple as everyone’s saying, and done and dusted in two or three weeks,"" said one investment banker.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced a string of changes to the pandemic response program late on Friday afternoon, which the government had put in place to keep workers linked to their employers. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has made some changes to the JobKeeper wage program.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen While broadly welcomed by the business community with more than 400,000 formally enrolling in the scheme this week, there have been a series of complaints about its structure and operation. They include pressures on small businesses to find a month's worth of wage payments upfront, much higher wages for almost 1.7 million part-time workers, rules governing charities and even the structure of firms. Accountants have discovered many firms have their employees listed in separate companies that fail the JobKeeper requirement to suffer a 30 per cent fall in income for operations with less than $1 billion revenue. Mr Frydenberg said on Friday that in order to protect the integrity and efficient operation of JobKeeper, a separate fall in turnover test would be created for firms that use a special purpose entity to employ their staff rather than being directly employed. The new test will include combined GST turnovers of the companies that use the entity which employs a firm's staff. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed this week concern even within businesses about the flat $1500 wage subsidy as it applied to young people earning a small amount of money. They would be paid the $1500 fortnight under the government's original design even if they were receiving less than $100. That has been now changed. ""The rules will provide that full time students who are 17 years old and younger, and who are not financially independent, are not eligible for the JobKeeper payment,"" the Treasurer said. Replay   Charities had complained that under JobKeeper they may be prevented from getting assistance if they received government payments for associated services such as aged care facilities. That will be changed, with charities able to exclude government revenue from their JobKeeper application. Priests, nuns and pastors will now be able to come under the scheme. Rules around businesses deciding which staff are covered by JobKeeper have been formalised, with Mr Frydenberg saying employers cannot select which of their eligible staff can participate in the scheme. There have been growing complaints from businesses about the time it is taking for them to get formal approval from their banks for overdrafts or loans to cover their upfront wages bills. Banks are now putting in place hotlines for businesses to fast track their applications. ""The banks have also agreed to bring JobKeeper-related applications to the front of the queue and work with the ATO to accelerate the finance assessment process,"" Mr Frydenberg said.

That way, if one lab worker gets exposed to the virus, forcing colleagues into quarantine, the other group can step in unaffected. Senior Hospital Scientist Anna Condylios  at work in the lab of the Prince of Wales Hospital.Credit:Kate Geraghty The workload has been intense. This facility alone was running 2500 COVID-19 tests a day when transmission rates were at their peak. Senior medical virologist and director of the lab, Professor Bill Rawlinson, sounds almost affectionate when he talks of the machines and their ""workhorse"" capacity. But while rate of testing hasn’t abated – indeed NSW is now ramping up to 8000 tests a day – the number of positive results has fallen dramatically. Nationally, Australia had only 13 new cases in the 24 hours until early Friday morning, for a cumulative total of 6667 cases, with fewer than 80 deaths. It's a stunning achievement. Experts are wondering if we’ve pulled off a miracle. The talk is not just of suppression of the virus, but possible elimination of the scourge of COVID-19 altogether from parts of the country. Internationally, we have become part of a small and fortunate club – including New Zealand, Germany and Norway – where suppression has worked so well governments are looking for ways to take their foot off the brake, to ease the burden of lockdowns on their communities and their economies. This week, the national cabinet of federal and state leaders flagged small but sentinel steps towards that goal. Some categories of elective surgery are to be resumed in hospitals. Sydney’s most famous eastern suburbs beaches were partially reopened for swimming and surfing. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has floated the idea of allowing travel between Australia and New Zealand. In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian wants students gradually returning to their classrooms from May 11, though in Victoria the preference remains for home-schooling. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt described the elective surgery decision as a ""very important day on the road back"" even as he and Morrison warned remaining strictures would stay in place for at least the next three weeks. Morrison has laid down several markers for easing social distancing measures. These include keeping the transmission rate for COVID-19 below one for each person infected (currently the case for all states except Tasmania), broadening testing capacity, building up ""industrial scale"" contact-tracing and having swift response plans for outbreaks. On Friday, the national cabinet unveiled an even more ambitious testing program as part of what Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy called a ""pandemic intelligence plan"", looking to expand tests to include asymptomatic people in a range of front-line occupations. ""We want to be testing 40,000, 50,000 Australians a day if necessary"", he said. The lessons of Singapore and Tasmania are stark reminders of how quickly the virus can flare, warns Monash University’s Professor Allen Cheng, who sits on the peak Australian Health Protection Principal Committee which advises the national cabinet. Singapore was initially held up as a shining example of how to contain the virus, but disease is now running rampant through migrant worker dorms. In Tasmania, despite the island sealing its borders against the mainland, a hospital outbreak most likely linked to a returning Ruby Princess passenger plunged thousands into lockdown in the state’s north-west. Replay   Cheng says it’s a reminder to keep a lookout for where our exposed ""underbelly"" might be. ""Have we addressed all our vulnerabilities, things like remote Indigenous communities, or asylum seeker detention facilities,"" he challenges. ""We need to get [extra measures] in place so that if we relax, and something happens in some of these settings, we know how to respond really quickly to get on top of it … It only takes one slip-up or chance event, and things can fall apart very quickly."" Prisons and aged care homes are also potential Achilles heels. Yet like many other public health experts, Cheng is sensitive to the pressure for easing strictures. ""We don't want to do more than we need to,"" he says. ""All the public health people understand that having millions of people out of work is not good for [community] health or anything else. Everyone feels that pressure."" Tellingly, one of the nation’s top modellers, Professor Jodie McVernon of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, found herself challenged on ABC TV’s Q+A this week about whether early and much more pessimistic modelling of the disease’s progression in Australia had been wrong. No, she shot back. The models had not been wrong. They had helped avert the horrors of makeshift morgues in the back of refrigerated trucks because ""our government listened to these predictions at a time when many others didn’t, and that is why Australia has not had go to through that"". Berejiklian warned on Friday that case numbers would inevitably begin climbing again once people started mixing more freely. So too would hospital admissions for the virus. She has urged everyone in the state with even the mildest of symptoms to present for a test. Victoria is doing the same. But the national cabinet decision on Friday will mean the net is now cast even wider – in what is called ""sentinel testing"" – to include categories of people who might be flashing no warning light for infection at all. Senior Hospital Scientist Vidiya Ramachandran with a coronavirus sample in the Virology Laboratory at the Prince of Wales Hospital.Credit:Kate Geraghty Another key part of broad surveillance plans will be serological surveys, broad-scale blood testing to determine how far the virus has made its way silently through the broader community. The first results from serosurveys in New York this week suggested as many as 2.7 million New Yorkers could have picked up the virus, vastly more than limited case testing has revealed. Serosurveys detect antibodies, the defences manufactured by our bodies against viral invaders. They are particularly useful for identifying people who may never have fallen ill yet still, at some point in the past, became infected. The Doherty Institute’s Professor Deborah Williamson says serology is still ""finding its way"" in the battle against COVID-19 but predicts it will be ""paramount"" in getting a more accurate picture of the extent of infection in the community. That, in turn, will help shape decisions about negotiating the path out of lockdown. Two leading epidemiologists, Professor John Kaldor of the Kirby Institute in Sydney, and Professor Kristine Macartney, of Westmead’s National Centre For Immunisation Research and Surveillance, have now won funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council to start designing Australia's first COVID-19 serosurvey. ""The key issue to be decided is which populations and which tests,"" Kaldor says. ""The most important thing is to set up a mechanism that is repeatable, so it can track changes in the community."" The work will involve looking for relevant antibodies in tens of thousands of Australians over the long term. ""We know that a substantial proportion of people, particularly among the young, don't have symptoms and may never know they had the infection."" The survey will explore that story as well as indicate what proportion of the population might have acquired some immunity – though right now no-one is sure how much immunity COVID-19 antibodies bestow, or for how long. Federal Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says serology tests would start ""pretty soon but I can’t put a date on it"". The serosurvey strategy would have to be large and representative of the national population, he adds. The researchers could test blood bank donations, or piggyback routine blood tests. GP clinics or shopping centres were other options, but Kelly says the most obvious sites for serosurveys were the COVID fever clinics already performing PCR [nose and throat] swab tests across the country. ""It’s premature to speculate,"" Kelly says. ""We’ll have those discussions in coming weeks."" An even greater challenge is settling on which test to use. Many are now flooding onto the market, but have a propensity for yielding false positives which can distort the true rate of underlying infection. ""Antibody tests have a false positivity rate in this area, often of 1, 2 or 3 per cent,"" says Professor Brendan Crabb, director of Melbourne's Burnet Institute. ""That doesn't sound very much, but ... if you do a sero-prevalence survey with an error rate of 1 per cent and your [infection] prevalence rate is 0.1 per cent, you may be wrong nine out of 10 times."" Sanjay Adhikari delivers samples that are to be tested for coronavirus at the Prince of Wales Hospital.  Credit:Kate Geraghty One reason for false positives is when tests cross-react to antibodies generated by more common coronaviruses and not just COVID-19. Kelly says two laboratories, one at Westmead in Sydney and another at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, are now running quality-control experiments for the government. Crabb says the Burnet institute is working on its own antibody test but he’s confident that ""whether it is our [test] or someone else’s, in the next few weeks the country will have a really good sense of what we can use for which purpose, and what we can’t"". The ""when"" to ease social controls is not about picking a specific date, he says. It’s ""when mechanisms are in place to track the virus in the community. Let’s hope that is one week away but it could be much longer than three weeks."" The federal government is urging millions of Australians to download the voluntary app that will warn people when they've been in close proximity to a known COVID-19 case. Other European countries are venturing down this road as well, following in Singapore’s footsteps. In Norway they call it ""Smittestop"" – contagion stop. Privacy advocates remain worried about the temptation to turn the app to other purposes. Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter has announced he will regulate to ensure law enforcement agencies are not able to access the data it generates. Cheng sees the app as a necessary trade-off for relaxing some of the lockdown measures. ""The thinking behind the app is to build up contact tracing,"" he says. ""We have to do even better at that if we are going to relax something else."" In NSW, the marshalling of data to fight COVID-19 has another enthusiastic proponent in Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello. He recounted this week how he had called together top information officers from all major departments just two days after the State Emergency Operations Centre was stood up, ordering them to pool information to respond to the pandemic. ""All the major [data] dashboards from [departments] have now been drawn into one place,"" he says. The state Data Analytics Centre, which he set up five years ago, is using aggregated and anonymised data from a wide range of state agencies as well as from banks, telcos, Google and Apple to produce what he calls ""mobility tracking"". Credit card information supplied by banks, for instance, can reveal whether people are spending in their neighbourhood, or 20 kilometres from home. ""If there are lot of people in a given suburb moving around, that speaks to a higher risk of transmission,"" Dominello says. ""The health data is telling you whether there is a hotspot, but these other systems become relevant for telling you why a hotspot has developed."" Or, indeed, where another might spring up. Dominello has adopted the North American terminology of the ""hammer and dance"" to describe how the virus might be managed with localised lockdowns, should outbreaks occur once social distancing measures are relaxed. ""You dance with the virus while it is in a suppressed state,"" he says, ""but if it pops its head up, you hammer it down .. you have to do it fast, you have to do it hard, and you have to do it local."" Not using data in this way, he insists, is akin to undertaking surgery blindfolded. ""We have got to start building this into future planning because to suggest there is not going to be a COVID-22 or a COVID-24, or whatever, is just reckless."" Brendan Crabb is still scratching his head over why Australia, thus far, has enjoyed such relative success. ""We acted very early on our borders, that was good,"" he says. ""Then we acted fast enough on our lockdown - two weeks later, and we don't know what would have happened. However there may also have been something else we don’t know about yet, about Australia and New Zealand. Is it because we are islands? Is it because we have fairly sparse populations? We don’t know. But I suspect there is a third reason that one day will become a bit clearer as to why in this early stage we have been so successful."" Professor Bill Rawlinson at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Sydney. Credit:Kate Geraghty Bill Rawlinson, surveying his domain at the Prince of Wales lab, is phlegmatic. ""As a virologist, I know there will be another pandemic,"" he says. He starts to quote Tommy Lee Jones’ Agent K from the film Men In Black. ""‘There is always an Arquillian Battle Cruiser, or a Corillian Death Ray, or an intergalactic plague that is about to wipe out all life on this miserable little planet, and the only way … people can get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it.’ ""Something else will come after this,"" he adds. It may be an isolated outbreak that affects a handful of people, it might be something worse. ""But the point is these things always come along. We expect it and we will expect others, and we need to be prepared.""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the government wanted to get Australians back into recreational sport ""as soon as we can"", and the national cabinet of state and territory leaders agreed to develop principles for sport and recreation to get consistency across the country. Prime Minister Scott Morrison.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen ""We want to get back to a place where [playing sport] can happen and we can have the confidence to do it safely,"" Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Friday. The national cabinet has agreed to craft principles by next week on both amateur and professional sports, which will include details governing the hoped return of competition for the NRL and AFL. The Prime Minister also unveiled new safe workplace principles agreed to by the national cabinet, urging businesses to work with employees to be prepared for a coronavirus outbreak. Mr Morrison said the ten principles were ""all about getting Australians back to work"" while ensuring there are procedures in place ""should a [COVID-19] case present in a workplace"", including readying workplaces for social distancing and ""exemplary hygiene measures that will be an important part of the transition"". Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy outlined the latest expert modelling, showing a dramatic reduction in the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 after the government introduced border restrictions and social distancing requirements. He said Australia had reached a total of 6673 confirmed cases on Friday, including 78 deaths, but that more than 5000 patients had now recovered. Just 43 are in intensive care units, with 29 of those on ventilators. Professor Murphy said with the exception of Tasmania, where a hospital outbreak caused a spike in transmissions, the reproduction rate of the virus had been kept below one, meaning each person with SARS-CoV-2 infects no more than one other person. He said health authorities must keep this figure below 1 to prevent the coronavirus from spreading out of control and ""we have to not be complacent"". The update came a week into the four-week timeframe the government has allocated to monitoring transmission rates before any restrictions are lifted. Professor Murphy said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee that he chairs would make recommendations to the national cabinet on ""gently, carefully, cautiously relaxing distancing measures"". This could include gradually increasing the number of people who can gather together in homes or public places, currently set at two in NSW and Victoria, he said, with the rules likely to vary across states depending on the level of community transmission. Replay   He said while border closures had kept the reproduction figure low, the emergence of community transmission in March meant ""if we hadn't put those distancing measures, we may have seen it rapidly go above 1 fairly quickly"". ""National cabinet is very clear that they want to be absolutely confident before relaxing any measures that we are in a position in this country to detect any community transmission of any significance,"" Professor Murphy said. The Prime Minister also ramped up his demand for aged care facilities to stop locking out visitors, warning that operators may be forced to seek federal government permission to bar visits from friends and families and keep the elderly confined to their rooms.

When her son, who had been charged over his role in a pub brawl, was presented with further charges by police Croke told him not to worry and that because ""it’s basically all crap"". When his day in court arrived on January 30, 2009 the young man said he was bewildered when Croke, at the bar table, nodded to him to plead guilty to the new charges. Despite expressing his shock at what had happened in court that day, Croke assured him it would all be fine. ""I’ve been doing this for over 20 years … don’t worry, you will only get a slap on the wrist,"" his solicitor said. But the young man didn’t get a slap on the wrist - he was jailed for two-and-a-half years. In 2010 he told the NSW Court of Appeal he had not read or signed the statement of facts. ""I would never have agreed to what it said as it was not true,"" he said. In a scathing assessment of Croke, appeal court judge Anthony Whealy said that ""at no time"" had the man been shown the agreed statement of facts, nor were they explained to him. ""Mr Croke, of course, insisted that they were. It is significant, however, that Mr Croke was unable to produce notes of any conference that he had ever had."" Nor could the solicitor produce any written instructions relating to the plea, Justice Whealy said. Ordering the convictions be quashed and the young man be released without the delay, Justice Whealy said the episode had been a ""serious miscarriage of justice"". Croke subsequently received a ""reprimand"" from the Law Society for, among other things, failing to explain to his client what he was pleading guilty to. This was not the first time the judiciary had had reason to be concerned about Croke’s unprofessional conduct. In 1999 District Court Judge Joe Phelan was furious when Croke failed to turn up on the first day of his client’s trial, causing a three-month delay. Judge Phelan noted that Croke had done this before. The judge advised the accused to find someone else to represent him. One of Croke’s own co-accused, music promoter Andrew McManus, had previously sued him for professional negligence. McManus, who was sentenced to a 20-month intensive corrections order over his role in lying to police over the $702,000, gave evidence at Croke's trial that the solicitor had coached him on his fabricated version of events.

25,/national/old-battlefield-falls-silent-as-a-new-struggle-is-fought-in-solitude-20200424-p54mui.html,Old battlefield falls silent as a new struggle is fought in solitude,"The weather-worn hills and gullies of the Gallipoli Peninsula are empty of all but ghosts now. The cold mists of April nights settle among deserted gravestones, only to be burned off by spring sunshine with no one to witness it. A plague is abroad. Anzac Day is cancelled — even here, among the tens of thousands of the long dead. Replay   They are paradoxically beautiful, those rows of headstones within their tended oases: 31 cemeteries for the lost of Australia, New Zealand, Britain, India and Newfoundland, a single graveyard for the French, and more than 50 gravesites, memorials and cemeteries dedicated to the Turkish defenders. Here is where Australians and New Zealanders, having sailed from the other side of the world, learned the hideous meaning of war. In our new century, April routinely draws thousands of a new generation from both those countries to this scrubby landscape with its dusty ridges, there to drift among the graves and to crowd the shore, awaiting the dawn and a bugler’s Last Post. In recent years, even warnings of terrorist attacks have not been enough to dissuade the crowds from coming for Anzac Day. But in 2020, a global desperation has condemned the old place to the status of the silent, desolate outpost it became for years after the armies that had tried and failed to wrest it from the Ottoman Empire had sailed away, leaving tens of thousands of bodies in the hills. This week, a well-known Gallipoli guide and tour operator, Ilhami ""TJ"" Gezici, ventured to the peninsula and took a series of photos of Anzac Cove, Lone Pine, Shrapnel Valley and other famous spots. All of them were empty of human life. ""There’s nothing eerie about the photos when you look at them,"" wrote TJ. The cemetery at Lone Pine this week. It is closed to visitors. Credit:TJ (Ilhami Gezici) ""But the feeling of standing on the peninsula without any tourists and just the sounds of nature is both a privilege and a sadness that leaves you with a great sense of loss for the world."" The coronavirus crisis, then, has done what no one might have imagined: cancelled Anzac Day at the very place it earned its name.

French President Emmanuel Macron, announcing his decision last month to invoke a national lockdown, stated several times ""we are at war"". In the days before COVID-19 almost killed him, Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, reaching for a Churchillian flourish, told his nation: ""We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. This enemy can be deadly, but it is beatable."" US President Donald Trump, once he had finished declaring criticism of his response to the pandemic a hoax, described himself as ""a wartime President"". Elevating his verbosity to the realm of battle with a foreign power, he spoke of ""our war against the Chinese virus"", which he now calls ""the invisible enemy"".

The cold mists of April nights settle among deserted gravestones, only to be burned off by spring sunshine with no one to witness it. A plague is abroad. Anzac Day is cancelled — even here, among the tens of thousands of the long dead. Replay   They are paradoxically beautiful, those rows of headstones within their tended oases: 31 cemeteries for the lost of Australia, New Zealand, Britain, India and Newfoundland, a single graveyard for the French, and more than 50 gravesites, memorials and cemeteries dedicated to the Turkish defenders. Here is where Australians and New Zealanders, having sailed from the other side of the world, learned the hideous meaning of war. In our new century, April routinely draws thousands of a new generation from both those countries to this scrubby landscape with its dusty ridges, there to drift among the graves and to crowd the shore, awaiting the dawn and a bugler’s Last Post. In recent years, even warnings of terrorist attacks have not been enough to dissuade the crowds from coming for Anzac Day. But in 2020, a global desperation has condemned the old place to the status of the silent, desolate outpost it became for years after the armies that had tried and failed to wrest it from the Ottoman Empire had sailed away, leaving tens of thousands of bodies in the hills. This week, a well-known Gallipoli guide and tour operator, Ilhami ""TJ"" Gezici, ventured to the peninsula and took a series of photos of Anzac Cove, Lone Pine, Shrapnel Valley and other famous spots. All of them were empty of human life. ""There’s nothing eerie about the photos when you look at them,"" wrote TJ. The cemetery at Lone Pine this week. It is closed to visitors. Credit:TJ (Ilhami Gezici) ""But the feeling of standing on the peninsula without any tourists and just the sounds of nature is both a privilege and a sadness that leaves you with a great sense of loss for the world.""

While the US has the world's highest death toll, it has the seventh-highest mortality rate of 15.2 per 100,000 persons. Belgium, Spain, Italy, France, the UK and the Netherlands all have higher mortality rates than the US. Donald Trump has been under huge pressure as a result of his handling of the pandemic, just seven months out from the US election. Don't miss this great read from our US correspondent Matthew Knott, who takes a look at how America's polarisation has shaped the country's response: A partisan pandemic: How Fox News shaped Trump's coronavirus response Dettol has issued a statement saying that ""under no circumstance"" should people ingest or inject disinfectant into themselves to treat coronavirus.  The extraordinary statement follows Donald Trump's comments at his news conference on Thursday night, in which the US President suggested trials could be carried out to see if disinfectant or UV light could kill coronavirus in the human body. Replay   Dettol issued a statement on its website, saying it had been asked ""whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus."" The company was unequivocal.  ""As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route). ""As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. ""Please read the label and safety information.

The closure came as the UK's death toll climbed to 19,506 after 684 new fatalities were recorded. According to Downing St, 5000 kits were ordered in the first two minutes the website went live.  Around 15,000 tests were booked to take place at drive-thru sites on the first day tests were extended to all key workers and members of their households. ""There has been significant demand for booking tests today,"" the department said.  ""We apologise for any inconvenience. We are continuing to rapidly increase availability. More tests will be available tomorrow."" The huge demand for testing is at odds with the UK government's claim that it has been testing fewer than 30,000 people per day because of a lack of demand. The government has been under pressure over its lack of testing capacity, which is being boosted to 100,000 per day by the end of April.

Trump noted on Thursday, local time, that researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if they could be injected into people, saying the virus ""does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that"". Replay   That prompted a strong warning from the maker of disinfectants Dettol and Lysol, which said it was issuing a statement to combat ""recent speculation."" ""As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),"" said the statement from Reckitt Benckiser. The White House accused the media of misrepresenting Trump's comment. ""President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasised again during yesterday's briefing,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. ""Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines."" Researchers are testing the effect of disinfectants on virus-laden saliva and respiratory fluids in the laboratory, said William Bryan, who leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. They kill the virus very quickly, he said. ""And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,"" Trump said. ""Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds - it sounds interesting to me."" In a White House briefing, President Donald Trump wondered aloud if disinfectants could be injected into people.Credit:AP Bryan said injections weren't part of that disinfectant research. The President has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine as he encourages US states to move to reopen their economies. On Thursday, the White House also pitched ""emerging"" research on the benefits of sunlight and humidity in diminishing the threat of the coronavirus. Past studies have not found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus. But Bryan said at a White House briefing on Thursday that there are ""emerging results"" from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air. He said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity. A bio-containment lab in Maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since February, Bryan said. ""The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity,"" Bryan said. Trump was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people have died in Florida. ""I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that's great,"" Trump replied, adding, ""It's just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man."" ""I'm here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that's a great thing as far as I'm concerned,"" the President said. Bryan stressed that the emerging results of the light and heat studies do not replace social distancing recommendations. Earlier in the month, scientific advisers told the White House there was no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures. Researchers convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine analysed studies done so far to test virus survival under different laboratory conditions as well as tracking where and how COVID-19 has spread so far. ""Given that countries currently in 'summer' climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,"" the researchers wrote earlier in April in response to questions from the White House Office of Science and Technology. In addition, the report cited the global lack of immunity to the new virus and concluded, ""if there is an effect of temperature and humidity on transmission, it may not be as apparent as with other respiratory viruses for which there is at least some pre-existing partial immunity."" They noted that during 10 previous flu pandemics, regardless of what season they started, all had a peak second wave about six months after the virus first emerged. In March, Dr Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation's emergencies chief, said: ""We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.""

29,/national/nsw/give-it-a-whirl-regional-cities-call-for-trial-of-relaxed-restrictions-20200424-p54n1p.html,'Give it a whirl': regional cities call for trial of relaxed restrictions,"Major cities in NSW are angling to become a test case for the relaxation of social distancing restrictions, in a move that is dividing experts with fears it could birth a second wave of coronavirus infections in the bush. Mayors representing Bathurst, Mudgee and Dubbo say their towns would be ideally placed to trial the easing of restrictions - if such a strategy was endorsed by NSW health authorities - because of their scant case numbers. Dubbo is one of the regional cities that has put its hand up for the relaxation of social distancing measures. Credit:Janie Barrett Any such move is likely to also require the consideration of internal border controls to protect towns that reopen, as is already in place in Western Australia. Mid-Western Regional Council, which takes in Mudgee, has had six confirmed COVID-19 cases. Mayor Des Kennedy argued it was a ""fabulous idea"" for authorities to use sparsely populated towns as a yardstick. ""We're nearly free of active cases,"" he said. ""Give it a whirl for a month and if you see all of a sudden that region gets cases, we know we’re going too soon."" Adrian Piccoli, director of the Gonski Institute for Education and a former NSW Coalition education minister, also argued schools should reopen full-time in unaffected regional areas. ""When there's a bushfire, you don't have to shut every school because a dozen schools are closed,"" he said. ""If there was an outbreak of the virus in Condobolin, they would not shut schools in Woollahra."" Professor Piccoli said their sprawling facilities were well-suited to social distancing. But the concept of tiered restrictions has met opposition, including from Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, who argued on Sky News it was a case of ""one in, all in"". Regional towns popular with tourists have also been less than enthusiastic. Community leaders from the South Coast and Snowy Mountains warned they would be inundated by Sydneysiders if relaxations went ahead. Snowy Monaro Regional Council has recorded six COVID-19 cases, and normally its businesses - battered by the bushfires - would have been relying heavily on the upcoming snow season. But mayor Peter Beer said it would be impossible to prevent an influx of visitors if there was any easing of rules. ""If we do get a big crowd like we do in winter, our medical facilities cannot handle an outbreak,"" he said. Associate Professors Adam Kamradt-Scott and Adam Dunn from Sydney University developed an interactive dashboard that could be key to determining which local government areas could relax their social distancing measures first. Professor Dunn said there was a risk people could become confused by mixed messages if there were different rules for different towns. ""You could have a situation where people aren't aware of local restrictions, you could have shops open when they're not meant to,"" he said. ""The last thing we want to see is a big second wave, that would be terrible."" Professor Kamradt-Scott was also involved in developing Australia's pandemic plans and said they allowed for a regional-first approach. However, he said the easing of restrictions was a decision for the government and internal border controls were likely to be a significant issue. ""It would involve a hell of a lot of resources, and the question is, is that an appropriate use of resources at this point in time?"" he said. The mayor of Dubbo Regional Council, Ben Shields, was supportive of a reopening if it was recommended. But he was dubious about the effectiveness of internal border controls. ""Dubbo is a shopping destination for all of western NSW,"" he said. ""Dubbo has a population of around 58,000, but 130,000 people do their business and shopping in Dubbo.""

But this Anzac Day will be like no other, and instead the group will watch themselves perform on television from their own isolated locations. Australian band The Rubens with lead singer Sam Margin on the right.Credit:Chris Lane Earlier this week, the band recorded a performance that will be broadcast as part of Saturday's Music From The Home Front concert, to pay respects to the Anzacs and recognise the work of frontline health care workers in Australia. It was the first time the band members had all been in the same place for two months. ""I honestly can't really think back to a time when we haven't seen each other for this long,"" lead singer Sam Margin said. ""We had been recording up to the point we all had to go into isolation, so it's good to have this reason to get back into the studio, at a safe 1.5-metre distance, to record this."" The launch of what was to be their fourth studio album is now on hold, but they did release a single from the recording sessions to satiate fans' appetite for new music. The track Heavy Weather was released on Tuesday and Margin said it was strange not being together to celebrate. ""Just not seeing the band members is hard, we are used to spending so much time on the road together. I would say most of the time when we are releasing something, on release day we are touring somewhere and we will watch how it is doing together,"" he said. ""The group chat is going off, basically."" With the album release on hold and their biggest-ever national tour postponed, Margin and his band mates would be justified in feeling miffed by the situation. But he is surprisingly pragmatic about it. ""Because everyone is going through something at the same time I don't feel so disappointed,"" he said. The Rubens are joined on the concert line-up by a star-studded list of Australian musicians including Archie Roach, Courtney Barnett, Dean Lewis, Delta Goodrem, Emma Donovan, G Flip, James Morrison, Bliss N Eso, Lee Kernaghan, Marlon Williams, Kevin Parker of Tame Impala, Vance Joy and others. The event is the brainchild of music promoter Michael Gudinski and Cold Chisel frontman Jimmy Barnes, who promises two very special performances on the night. Jimmy Barnes has been learning the bagpipes in lockdown. ""Ian Moss and myself are going to do a song together, with my son in Brisbane, my daughter in the [NSW Southern] Highlands, I'm in another part of the Highlands and Mossy is in Sydney, and we are going to do When the War Is Over,"" Barnes said. Later he will be joined by his brother-in-law Mark ""Diesel"" Lizotte for a darker, pared-back version of Barnes' 1985 hit Working Class Man. ""Anzac Day is going to be a very unusual time, I think it is the first time since the war that we haven't been able to go out and march,"" Barnes says. ""I think it is important that we pay our respect to the Anzacs, show support to the armed forces and show support for everybody at home. ""It's not the same as being in a war but we are fighting a hidden enemy here with this virus."" Barnes has been giving people a taste of what they are likely to see in the concert via regular live performances on Instagram with his wife Jane, including a recent video which demonstrated his new-found prowess on the bagpipes. ""We are having a great time,"" he said. ""We are loving just being in our home, getting to play a bit of music and learn things we don't normally get time to do because I am constantly touring or travelling."" The Music From The Home Front concert will be broadcast on Nine (which owns this masthead) from 7.30pm Saturday.

The closures come as Inner West Council mayor Darcy Byrne issued a warning to the population to stay away from the popular Bay Run pedestrian and cycling route this weekend.

""The vast majority of people are very conscious of the fact it's important to keep their distance,"" Cr Byrne said. ""But it's a big challenge because people need to be able to get outside to exercise."" The council has decided to turn on floodlights at multiple parks and sporting ovals across the inner west from 4.30pm to allow people to exercise and walk their dogs safely at night - and to disperse crowds on the Bay Run. The measures, which were approved at this week's council meeting, will continue for the duration of the coronavirus crisis and cover parks and ovals in Haberfield, Leichhardt, Croydon, Annandale, Marrickville, Rozelle, Petersham and Tempe.

It comes amid mounting concern about casual workforces across the state's universities. Western Sydney University has warned staff it will cut casual workloads next semester; Sydney University is slashing 30 per cent of its arts courses; and one-third of casuals at the University of NSW have reported losing work. But it has been unclear if universities would meet the threshold to access JobKeeper, as the federal government on Friday rejected La Trobe University's bid for the subsidy. Sydney University expects a $470 million hit to its bottom line as a result of COVID-19.Credit:Louise Kennerley In an email to staff on Friday, Sydney University vice-chancellor Michael Spence said the university could receive between $100 and $140 million in JobKeeper funding if the majority of eligible staff apply. ""This would be an incredible improvement on our financial situation and would help shape the scale of further savings measures currently being considered,"" he said. La Trobe's vice-chancellor John Dewar initially claimed the university had demonstrated at least 30 per cent reduction in turnover between March 2019 and 2020, and said JobKeeper would allow it to recover $50 million of its $150 million shortfall. But Mr Frydenberg issued a statement saying universities would have to include government funding in their turnover calculations, rejecting La Trobe's apparent rationale that government funding did not count as GST turnover, which is used to assess eligibility. ""Changes will clarify that the core Commonwealth government financial assistance provided to universities will be included in the JobKeeper turnover tests,"" a statement from Mr Frydenberg said. A spokeswoman for La Trobe said the university had acted in good faith and followed the published ATO guidelines. ""We are very disappointed that the application criteria have changed again. JobKeeper was set up to help protect jobs and by moving the goal posts a second time, this will cost jobs in universities,"" the spokeswoman said. Universities face the same requirements as businesses to qualify for JobKeeper. They must demonstrate a 30 per cent turnover decline if their revenue is under $1 billion and 50 per cent if it is above $1 billion. A University of Sydney spokeswoman said the university believed it met relevant criteria regardless of whether it calculated government funding. ""During one of the relevant periods of time, we calculated a revenue reduction of over 50 per cent in our GST turnover, whether or not government grants are included,"" she said. Sydney University expects a shortfall of $470 million this year, due in part to the loss of thousands of full fee-paying Chinese students. WSU vice-chancellor Barney Glover on Thursday told staff that there had been ""a great deal of speculation"" about JobKeeper in the higher education sector. ""Technically we are eligible to apply, but there are tests you have to pass ... The advice we received [is] no Australian university would be likely to pass the threshold,"" he said. At Sydney University, casual and fixed-term staff make up about 60 per cent of the workforce, according to the 2018 annual report. The university says fixed-term and long-term casual staff would be eligible for JobKeeper. Under the scheme, the government would subsidise the university $1500 a fortnight for each eligible staff member. A report compiled by the University of NSW Casuals Network showed that one in three casuals at the university had lost work this month, costing them an average of $626 a week, and 42 per cent were working unpaid hours.

Under the scheme, the government would subsidise the university $1500 a fortnight for each eligible staff member. A report compiled by the University of NSW Casuals Network showed that one in three casuals at the university had lost work this month, costing them an average of $626 a week, and 42 per cent were working unpaid hours.

But what happened next kickstarted a movement. By Konrad Marshall Tayla Harris: “I play two sports that are dominated by men, one you think of as a blood sport. But in reality I hate hurting people, physically or emotionally. It’s not in me to actually want to inflict pain.”Credit:Michael Willson Tayla Harris greets me in her lounge room, but also in my kitchen. Which is to say that we meet each other – for the first time – via screens. Her blonde hair is pulled back into a single tight ponytail, and she wears a bright yellow hoodie with the words KINDNESS NOW emblazoned across the chest. And she is lovely. Unhurried but attentive, without airs or affectation, and her smile on my iPad is borderline beatific. Seemingly all her teeth are involved. “You’ll have to excuse me,” she says, wolfing down a spoonful of risotto. “I’m eating dinner.” She’s definitely excused – I’m grateful for the glimpse of her day. The craft of profile writing, you see, hinges perilously on access – on scooping up colour and movement in the moments between moments, in looks and gestures and interactions. It means hanging around and writing it all down, and until the coronavirus pandemic kicked in, I was going to hang around Tayla Kate Harris as long as possible, to see what life is like when you’re only 23 yet one of the most noteworthy athletes in Australia. I was going to talk my way into a pre-game team meeting with the Carlton Football Club, which until the 2020 AFLW season was cancelled after round six was tipped to challenge for a premiership, with Harris as their dominant and high-flying centre half-forward. “She is an A-type athlete,” says journalist Samantha Lane. “She’s clinical but an animal. And she’s ravenous – always wanting to improve. Her talent and potential remind some of a young Lance Franklin, who can go on to be king, queen, lord, lordess … Whatever she wants.” I’d have studied that from the boundary line, then hopefully tagged along with her to the Team Ellis Gym in Melbourne’s outer suburbs, where Harris trained to become the reigning Australian female middleweight boxing champion last year and, a few months ago, added the super welterweight champion’s belt. It’s where she hits the heavy bag and learns life lessons, too, from her favourite Mike Tyson maxim – “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth” – to the mantra of her trainer, Faris Chevalier, which rings true beyond the ring: “Be comfortable with being uncomfortable.” Speaking of discomfort, I would have documented one of the many professional chores born of her burgeoning personal brand – perhaps a photo shoot or marketing meeting – to see how she wears her fame. Because make no mistake, Tayla Harris is famous. Eighteen months ago, she flew to Oregon to meet the executive team at Nike HQ, and became one of a handful of female athletes in its global Rallying Cry campaign.

Harris became the reigning Australian female middleweight boxing champion last year and, a few months ago, added the super welterweight champion’s belt.  Credit:Getty Images In the BBC’s recent annual global list of 100 inspiring and influential women, Harris was the only Australian. Player agent Alex Saundry represents some of the best talent in the AFLW, but the press requests she gets for “Tay” dwarf all others. “Sometimes I have to try to remind her – and myself – that she’s 23 – just so she doesn’t lose that. So she enjoys this ride,” says Saundry. “But yeah, Tay is the biggest name in the game.” I’d have watched people orbit her star at public events, whether mingling with school kids or glad-handing corporates. That’s part of what she was doing at the start of 2020, as an ambassador for Our Watch, promoting the prevention of violence against women and children, both physical and psychological. She knows the topic well, of course, after a photo of her kicking a footy 13 months ago drew sexist and sexually violent abuse online. Patty Kinnersly, a Carlton board member and CEO of Our Watch, says the defiance and eloquence of Harris in that moment sparked a howl of emotion not unlike when family violence campaigner Rosie Batty first spoke after the killing of her young son in 2014. “There are things that happen in history, and capture the community in a way that we say, ‘That’s not okay.’ Tayla became the voice of a movement.” That voice, though, is subject to the staggers and silences of the fallible video conferencing platform we’re using to chat. We talk four times at the start of April, and each time she’s only just finished working out. One day it’s lifting borrowed barbells, or thrashing around on something called an assault cycle, set up in the corner of the lounge room next to her red leather couch. Another time, the online anthropomorphic torture session known as Zuu, with exercise names such as “lizard” and “gorilla”. Today, it’s conditioning: hill-climbs and 40-second sprint efforts. “Awful. Throw-up kind of awful,” she emphasises. Harris was late to our chat because of her running session, and her lightly freckled face is still flushed from exertion. “I didn’t think I’d need to shower but I was just so disgusting I had to. I wore my Costanza T-shirt for you!” (We had chatted once about Seinfeld – both big fans – so Harris donned a long-sleever with George on the front and “Can’t stand ya” on the back, in my honour.) “The one thing fighting is definitely not about – for me – is aggression. I’m better when I’m calm and calculated.” She’s remarkably upbeat in isolation, which I put down to endorphins. “I don’t just train to compete. I actually enjoy training, which makes it that much better,” she confirms. “I have no idea when I’m going to play footy again, or box again, or do anything really, but that’s okay. If it takes a long time, I’ll just continue to get ready.” Footy for Harris and likely boxing, too, won’t be back until 2021, so this star interrupted is making the most of social distancing. She’s eating the greens she hates, because she knows she has to. She’s drowning all other food in tomato sauce, because she wants to. She’s drinking her milk and watching her Love Island and walking her dog – a border collie named Beans – around her neighbourhood in suburban Strathmore, north-west of Melbourne, where she lives with her partner, Collingwood’s attacking midfielder Sarah Dargan. “There’s parks all around, and local shops down the road,” she says. “It’s a lot like where I grew up.” Harris walking her dog, Beans, around her neighbourhood. Credit:Courtesy of Lisa Harris Let’s go to where she grew up, in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. Dad Warren was a marine engineer with an enviable toolshed, and so little Tay grew up building chook pens and beehives, skateboards and jump ramps. “She had perfect timing and balance,” says Warren, who was once asked to train with Carlton and regrets turning the opportunity down. “I used to hold her by one arm in the supermarket and she’d swing around me like an orang-utan, swiping stuff from the shelves.” She was five when she played her first game of footy, with her only sibling, big brother Jack, then seven. Jack’s team was short a player, so Tay filled in and kicked six goals. She continued through junior footy with the Aspley Hornets, the only girl in a boys’ league, and at first wondered why they didn’t try harder to tackle her. Then she heard their parents on the sidelines. “Don’t touch her,” they sneered. “You’ll get into trouble!” Other times it was the opposite, the confusion of the boys bringing out their worst. “Some just wanted to smash me more,” she says, shrugging. “Which I preferred, to be honest.” She was fearless, and not just on the field, freely driving a water-skiing boat at over 100 kilometres an hour when only nine. At 12, she was rag-dolled by a bigger opponent and began boxing lessons at the local Police-Citizens Youth Club. Trained by an ex-trawlerman with an eye patch, she revelled in the discipline. Still does. “The one thing fighting is definitely not about – for me – is aggression. I’m better when I’m calm and calculated, focusing on the way your hands sit in the gloves, or the angle of your feet for a punch. Boxing is not what it seems. And I’m not what I seem.” Growing up playing junior football in Queensland with the Aspley Hornets, Harris was the only girl playing in a boys’ league. While many opponents wouldn’t go near her, “some just wanted to smash me more,” she says, “which I preferred.” Credit:Courtesy of Lisa Harris Her mum, Lisa, an insurance claims manager, says people mistakenly see her daughter as cocksure and tough. “Deep down she is really soft,” she says. “Deep down she just wants to make sure she does the right thing by everyone.” Lisa remembers how her little blonde poppet used to sprint down the hallway and leap to touch the ceiling light. Every morning at school drop-off, Mum would say the same thing to her from behind the wheel: “Bye, have a good day, be kind!” When people lack compassion or respect, Harris finds it baffling. “Bullying at school just blew my mind,” she says, throwing up her hands. “How can someone be mean to someone else? I struggled to understand it, so school was a bit of a strange time.” Harris felt different as a young girl, wearing her brother’s hand-me-downs, getting sweaty and stinky playing basketball at lunchtime. “But feeling out of place isn’t necessarily a bad thing – I didn’t feel unwanted,” she clarifies. “Yet I always felt like at footy – at a game, or training, or at the club – I was in my element. I got an extreme high from that, whereas at school I probably struggled.” She excelled at women’s football at the perfect time, joining nascent interstate competitions and playing in early televised exhibition games as a teenager, before becoming a foundation AFLW player in 2017. She’s since played in two losing grand finals (2017 and 2019) and been All Australian twice (2017 and 2018). She knows the competition intimately and offers opinions freely. The pay gap – an average AFLW salary of around $17,000 versus an average AFL salary of more than $363,000 – doesn’t stick in her craw, either. One of the major issues for AFLW players and commentators is the short length of the season (eight weeks plus finals), but Harris breaks with the majority. “If the competition suddenly went from eight games to 14 games, with the minimal preseason we’ve got, the injuries would be astronomical,” she believes. “It’s a very interesting push, to ask for that season length so soon, when we’re not ready physiologically.” The pay gap – an average AFLW salary of around $17,000 versus an average AFL salary of more than $363,000 – doesn’t stick in her craw, either. “If we were training the exact same amount of hours as men, required to eat as we’re told, have skinfolds at a certain standard, play two or three times as many games – games that are twice as long – and had all of these boundaries set, then sure. But we don’t. If we’re asked to do more as the league grows, we should get paid more, and I think we will.” Put simply, Harris has faith in those who run the league, including AFL boss Gillon McLachlan and AFLW chief Nicole Livingstone, and takes them at their word when they say the league will resume post-pandemic with all 14 AFLW teams intact. She doesn’t care what “old-mate misogynistic sexist arsehole” thinks, nor does she truck with the growing impatience of fervent AFLW boosters. “These things don’t happen in five seconds. Our product is four years old. The men’s product is more than 150 years old,” she says. “We’re the baby, just crawling. It’s exciting what could come but it won’t be coming for a long time. I think there’s a bit more patience needed in this conversation.” Flash back now to Sunday March 17, 2019, at the Whitten Oval in Melbourne’s inner west. It’s the last round of season and a stunning autumn day. Harris chats on the field with AFL chief photographer Michael Willson, who takes a happy snap of her with her parents. The game begins, and within a minute Harris plucks a mark. Willson aims his Canon 1DX Mark II and snaps a sequence: “The frame I chose – where she’s at her highest point – is just an elite, magnificent athlete in full flight, with that spectacular leg extension and elevation.” He files the pic, and posts it on his social media accounts with a caption: You kick like a girl. This photo, aka “the kick”, sparked a deluge of online abuse – but Harris turned it into a teachable moment. Credit:Getty Images Harris first saw the photo not long after the game, around 6pm, online. In her book, More than a Kick: Footy, the Photo and Me, released next week, she notes: “A kick is such an intense moment. So much focus and concentration. There’s something almost poetic about it, all that hope poured into an action. It’s like we’re all in it together … Will she? Won’t she?” She was also tagged in a Channel 7 Facebook post by friends – “Nice shot Tay” – and found her way to the comments section. They were foul. “Initially, out of interest, I kept reading, and I was like, ‘This isn’t right,’ ” she says, scratching her head. “I wasn’t emotional, but in my mind I was just thinking, ‘This isn’t what people should be allowed to say.’ ” The worst? Someone had doctored the photo to make it look as though she wasn’t wearing anything below her jumper, going so far as to paste a vulva onto the image. That photoshopped picture was then cropped twice more, becoming a twisted triptych of a naked groin. Harris sat dumbstruck. “That particular photo had hundreds of likes,” she says, shaking her head. “And that’s when I was like, ‘That’s f…ed.’ ” In response, she posted the original photo to her own accounts. On Twitter: “Here’s a picture of me at work … think about this before your derogatory comments, animals.” And on Instagram: “My hamstring is okay but derogatory and sexist comments aren’t.” Harris was far from alone at this time. Messages of support and friend requests and calls and emails and tweets and posts popped up by the thousand. The backlash was vicious. Most mainstream stories then, and now, refer to the material posted as “vile language” and “sexist abuse”, but that doesn’t convey the depth of misogyny on show. It isn’t hard to find, incidentally. Live forums still exist from that time, in which countless comments are made by anonymous posters, perhaps with a photo of the paedophile Rolf Harris as their avatar, or maybe Pepe the Frog – a cartoon avatar of the alt-right movement. Such threads begin with one bruised male ego venting about the attention lavished on a strong young woman, and the poison drips down the screen. You feel it in the guts. The following is a small sample, not even the most egregious: OMG if she thinks that is sexual assault then maybe she should be charged with public nudity for exposing herself in the first place.Unknown female gets attention, then demands more.This broad needs help. I wouldn’t go out of my way to f… that.Spreading your legs a lot isn’t kicking hard.Sticks n Stones can break bones, And Words can also Penetrate me...F… she has a good chassis.I can smell her c...Women are so retarded. Harris was far from alone at this time. Messages of support and friend requests and calls and emails and tweets and posts popped up by the thousand. She estimates the attention she received that week was 90 per cent positive, 10 per cent pathetic. Sarah Dargan sits on Tayla’s lap during one Zoom meeting and recalls the outpouring. “I couldn’t erase the comments – all I could do was make sure Tayla was okay,” Dargan says. “But people just started backing Tay and standing up. It turned good so suddenly.” (In this bright moment my wife appears over my shoulder in our lounge room, and Harris pipes up: “Hi there!” she waves. “I love these new age business meetings!”) Harris quickly owned the moment. She launched the #taylakickchallenge, for instance, offering a free pair of footy boots for the best photo mimicking her distinctive kicking action. She sought to confirm the gendered basis of the attacks, so Patty Kinnersly talked her through it: “Such abuse is meant to maintain what some men feel is their right to a position of power,” says Kinnersly. “Their view that we shouldn’t be normalising, promoting and celebrating women in public life.” She also made it clear that Harris had no responsibility whatsoever to do or say anything. “Because when you go out and proud on these things, the abuse doesn’t stop,” says Kinnersly, “it triples.” But remember, Harris is fearless. And so, on the Tuesday after the Sunday, wearing a daggy old hoodie, she did a 6am radio interview hosted by her coach, former Hawthorn player Daniel Harford. “Her ability to compartmentalise what was thrown at her, and give this composed message right between the eyes – it was remarkable,” says Harford. “When I was 21 there’s no way I would have been able to deal with what she did, with all the humility and class and polish that she showed.” Replay   She turned it into a teachable moment. Channel 7 had removed the photo from its Facebook page because of the graphic attacks, but quickly reinstated the image with an apology, in response to the message that Harris was sharing, and still shares. If organisations can employ social media editors and content producers, she says, they need to employ people to monitor material, too. “If there was graphic vile graffiti on the front of your workplace, you would remove it, straightaway. You wouldn’t be okay with leaving it there,” she explains. “They can’t just think, ‘This is the way it is.’ They need to do better.” She changed things in footy, too. Carlton’s first instinct was suppression; a club memo advised no one to comment. “I disagreed,” says Harris. “This was my moment. I felt strongly about using it to say something important.” So she organised a press conference at the club’s Ikon Park headquarters, and football united behind her. People printed T-shirts with the photo on the front, or a silhouette of the kick, or the words, YES TO GOALS, NO TO TROLLS. Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the attackers “cowardly grubs”. Interview requests came from Europe and the United States, from BBC news and The New York Times. She went global. Harris with Carlton CEO Cain Liddle at a press conference she organised to discuss online abuse. Credit:Getty Images “It reminded me of the way Adam Goodes spoke the day after he was racially vilified by that young girl,” says journalist Samantha Lane. “I just felt happy, and proud. I’ll declare that I like her, that I want her to excel and the AFL women’s league to become strong and more followed, but I also want it to have the kind of substance that she showed in that moment. She elevated the conversation above the sports pages.” The only hesitation in her fight was the impact it might have on others – like her mum – who struggles to forget one particular threat: “ ‘I know where you live, and I’m going to come and bleep-bleep-bleep you’ – I was horrified,” Lisa says, pausing. “How dare you? How dare you speak about my baby that way?” That week, a club security guard nicknamed Meatball walked Harris between her car and the club rooms. And then, at the preliminary final that weekend, a security detail was assigned to her parents as well. “Someone had threatened to come to the game and shoot her on the field,” says her dad, a massive man who practises Thai boxing. Instead of watching his daughter play, Warren spent the game scanning the crowd. “I can tell you, if I saw anything strange, I would have been there quicker than any security guard. And the suspicious person? They wouldn’t have survived the experience.” “I hate the thought of a young girl looking at my page and thinking, ‘I want to be like her, but if I’m like her then I’ll get comments like that.’ I wouldn’t want anything to divert her path.” Harris herself maintains that even the worst of it is “water off a duck’s back”, but Warren guesses that some of it gets through. He wonders if his girl is pulling the same trick she did in junior footy, when bigger boys would hit her hard to prove a point. “Always just brushed it off. Never let them know she was hurt.” She tells me an anecdote, from the end of that tumultuous week, and her tone is casual. But I find it profoundly sad. It’s about protecting herself online, by muting and blocking, deleting and reporting, or refraining from tagging her location. “The only thing that I changed was that I started filtering out particular words, from my comments,” she says, holding up her mobile. “I hate the thought of a young girl looking at my page and thinking, ‘I want to be like her, but if I’m like her then I’ll get comments like that.’ I wouldn’t want anything to divert her path.” And so this star of the game, still only 21 at the time, sat at home with iPhone in hand, entering the words she expects to be lobbed at her by hidden strangers:  F…. Rape. Cock. Bitch. Slut. Whore. C….  Harris poses with her statue in Melbourne's Federation Square. She knew the abuse would continue after it was unveiled. Credit:AAP When this story is printed, Tayla Harris knows she will be abused again. She has a sense for such things. She knew it in September last year, when a bronze sculpture of “the kick” by artist Terrance Plowright was unveiled in Melbourne’s Federation Square. Young, female and outspoken – moulded in metal and put on a pedestal? Yeah, she knew. “If the statue was just for my footy, of course I wouldn’t deserve it,” she says, “but it’s not about me. You could do the statue without a head for all I care. It’s about a moment.” And that moment is still with us. Ask any female journalist or politician or public figure about the abuse they receive online. Only last month, the Herald Sun decided to disallow comments on all AFLW stories, acknowledging that even the most innocuous piece could draw execrable remarks by the dozen. Harris prefers another way, tweeting that she would give up her AFLW salary to employ someone to monitor social media. “Ignoring these comments is not a solution,” she wrote. “Fight back.” Julie Inman Grant, Australia’s eSafety commissioner, is the person to pick that fight. Flying back from the US when the drama unfolded, she recalls landing in Sydney to a missed call from the Prime Minister. “That’s not normal,” she points out. “When I called back, he was really distressed about what was happening to Tayla Harris. He saw it as absolutely reprehensible, and wanted to know what we were doing.” “To me, this is just the internet surfacing the reality – and sad underbelly – of misogyny on the human condition.” For one, the government has added a new adult cyber abuse scheme to its proposed Online Safety Act, giving Inman Grant’s office stronger take-down powers, with stiffer civil penalties for non-compliance. She’s also met with Facebook, Google and Twitter about pushing platforms to make user protections simpler, to act on third-party “bystander” reports of abuse, and to invest in artificial intelligence to detect and remove abusive content. A new Women Influencing Tech Spaces program is helping females with “social media self-defence training”, and discussions are underway with the AFL about a joint effort to counter online vilification. Employing more moderators is great, Inman Grant says, but you’re still playing a game of “whack-a-mole”, and not facing the core issue, which is societal. “To me, this is just the internet surfacing the reality – and sad underbelly – of misogyny on the human condition. There’s a longer-term cultural and behavioural issue we need to tackle.” That’s why Harris wrote her book. For the past year, people have been asking her for advice. More than a Kick is aimed at young readers, and deals with everything from sarcastic comments and fake friends to teenage anxiety about which pictures to post. There are tips on how to disagree politely, and how to stay safe. Of course, this crusade is only part of her brand, and in some ways its seriousness misrepresents her personality. The Harris I meet is funny and silly, spontaneous and carefree, a young woman who books flights without a return leg and freely admits she barely reads books. She’s Generation Z, with #nofilter. “She is who she is. She’s totally Insta,” says Sam Lane. “But she’s also really strategic. I met her when she was 20 years old, and even then she was seeing herself on a global stage.” Her brand is building. Nike sponsors her boots and runners. Dandenong Hyundai keeps her in a fresh set of wheels. She does junior coaching with Carlton’s Next Generation Academy, and has financial advisers to manage investment properties in Brisbane and Melbourne, and diversify her share portfolio. A deal with Colgate was signed this month, and the services group MC Labour has the naming rights to her boxing shorts (which she designed, with sequins and tassels). She recently trademarked her boxing logo – TH with a lightning bolt in the centre – and after lengthy negotiations Harris has permission to use the kick photo (owned by the AFL) to sell T-shirts with its silhouette online. Could that distinctive outline become her version of the iconic Michael Jordan “Jumpman” logo for an apparel range? “That’s in conversation,” says Saundry, her manager. “We’ve just gotta find a way to make something work.” Harris tackles Justine Mules of the Adelaide Crows during the Round 4 AFLW match at Richmond Oval in Adelaide, March 1, 2020. Credit:AAP Harris has an acting agent, too, and takes classes and workshops, knowing she will be called on for public speaking, and perhaps for roles in sports media. She looks up to the commercial success of mixed martial arts fighter and celebrity Rhonda Rousey, and lives by one of the brawler’s aspirational aphorisms: “If you can’t dream big, ridiculous dreams, what’s the point of dreaming at all?” Hopefully, amid all of this image curation, she remains unvarnished. Harris is at that age when star athletes often begin to sense their worth and clam up, offering only rare peeks into their  authenticity. Current evidence is – thankfully – to the contrary. In a post-match interview this season, an AFLW opponent said that if you nullify Harris in the air, she’s “useless” on the ground. Harris played to the theatre of the moment on Instagram, posting a photo of an apex predator with a glowing golden mane and these words: “A lion never loses sleep over the opinions of sheep.” In isolation, she’s also decided to take up a YouTube career, filming and editing a library of entertaining videos in which she chats about her life, or takes people through a workout. I had wanted to ask her about her tattoos, and her catalogue of ink is one of the first topics addressed on camera. It’s hard to know where Harris will end up. She certainly has no grand plan. She won’t even lock herself into footy. Messages of love from her mum and dad on the inside of either wrist. The heads of the four main characters in Seinfeld – Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine – on a forearm, even though she wasn’t born until 1997, eight years after the show premiered in 1989. “Fortune favours the brave” on the inside of her right elbow. The Buddhist symbol for enlightenment on her left thumb. “Lines, triangles, dots,” she says. “I just like shapes.” On one bum cheek, a picture of Judge Judy and the words “Only Judy can judge me.” And on the other cheek? A quote from Kris Jenner, offered to Kim Kardashian when she was doing a nude photo shoot: “You’re doing amazing sweetie.” She pulls down her bottom lip, and on the skin inside is a tattoo she got at Bondi Beach, one word in capital letters: STRAYA. When Harris interlocks her fingers, the middle knuckles line up to spell OXYMORON. “I play two sports that are dominated by men, one you think of as a blood sport. But in reality I hate hurting people, physically or emotionally,” she says. “It’s not in me to actually want to inflict pain. That’s the oxymoron – I’m the opposite of what I do.” Harris and partner Sarah Dargan at the 2019 Brownlow awards. On her future in the AFLW competition, she says: “The second I don’t want to be there, I won’t be. I don’t think you should do something that doesn’t make you happy.” Credit:Getty Images She is growing into herself as a player, too. Although she is the best contested mark in the league, and probably the longest kick, she played a more selfless role for her teammates this year, focusing on goal assists more than goals, and “halving” marking contests rather than always taking the big screamer. She’s not without quirks or fallibility. “Definitely messy!” says Dargan. “Every time she goes away, I clean the house. The minute she’s back, the suitcase hits the floor and she lives out of it for days. She’ll eat a Kit Kat and throw the rubbish on the floor.” Bizarrely, she won’t listen to music in the car – a safety measure she learnt from her dad. “It has to be silent, and it’s sooo boring. And awkward.” A big part of Saundry’s job is making sure Harris remains wild but doesn’t exhaust herself. “You want her to publicise the competition, but not carry the competition,” says Saundry, who once managed AFLW commentator and star Daisy Pearce. “Daisy carried the competition, and the amount of stress it put her under – I’d never want to see another athlete feel that obligation on her shoulders.” It’s hard to know where Harris will end up. She certainly has no grand plan. She won’t even lock herself into footy. She finds it “interesting” that fans are so emotionally invested, because she was never that way. Harris loves kicking and marking but acknowledges that kicking and marking is all it is. Some people suspect that, if some other challenge appealed to her more, she would drop the game. “That is accurate,” she says, pulling her hair back into that single taut ponytail she favours when running or kicking or punching. “The second I don’t want to be there, I won’t be. I don’t think you should do something that doesn’t make you happy. In my life, I come first.” 1800 RESPECT: 1800 737 732.

But what happened next kickstarted a movement. By Konrad Marshall Tayla Harris: “I play two sports that are dominated by men, one you think of as a blood sport. But in reality I hate hurting people, physically or emotionally. It’s not in me to actually want to inflict pain.”Credit:Michael Willson Tayla Harris greets me in her lounge room, but also in my kitchen. Which is to say that we meet each other – for the first time – via screens. Her blonde hair is pulled back into a single tight ponytail, and she wears a bright yellow hoodie with the words KINDNESS NOW emblazoned across the chest. And she is lovely. Unhurried but attentive, without airs or affectation, and her smile on my iPad is borderline beatific. Seemingly all her teeth are involved. “You’ll have to excuse me,” she says, wolfing down a spoonful of risotto. “I’m eating dinner.” She’s definitely excused – I’m grateful for the glimpse of her day. The craft of profile writing, you see, hinges perilously on access – on scooping up colour and movement in the moments between moments, in looks and gestures and interactions. It means hanging around and writing it all down, and until the coronavirus pandemic kicked in, I was going to hang around Tayla Kate Harris as long as possible, to see what life is like when you’re only 23 yet one of the most noteworthy athletes in Australia. I was going to talk my way into a pre-game team meeting with the Carlton Football Club, which until the 2020 AFLW season was cancelled after round six was tipped to challenge for a premiership, with Harris as their dominant and high-flying centre half-forward. “She is an A-type athlete,” says journalist Samantha Lane. “She’s clinical but an animal. And she’s ravenous – always wanting to improve. Her talent and potential remind some of a young Lance Franklin, who can go on to be king, queen, lord, lordess … Whatever she wants.” I’d have studied that from the boundary line, then hopefully tagged along with her to the Team Ellis Gym in Melbourne’s outer suburbs, where Harris trained to become the reigning Australian female middleweight boxing champion last year and, a few months ago, added the super welterweight champion’s belt. It’s where she hits the heavy bag and learns life lessons, too, from her favourite Mike Tyson maxim – “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth” – to the mantra of her trainer, Faris Chevalier, which rings true beyond the ring: “Be comfortable with being uncomfortable.” Speaking of discomfort, I would have documented one of the many professional chores born of her burgeoning personal brand – perhaps a photo shoot or marketing meeting – to see how she wears her fame. Because make no mistake, Tayla Harris is famous. Eighteen months ago, she flew to Oregon to meet the executive team at Nike HQ, and became one of a handful of female athletes in its global Rallying Cry campaign.

Credit:Getty Images In the BBC’s recent annual global list of 100 inspiring and influential women, Harris was the only Australian. Player agent Alex Saundry represents some of the best talent in the AFLW, but the press requests she gets for “Tay” dwarf all others. “Sometimes I have to try to remind her – and myself – that she’s 23 – just so she doesn’t lose that. So she enjoys this ride,” says Saundry. “But yeah, Tay is the biggest name in the game.” I’d have watched people orbit her star at public events, whether mingling with school kids or glad-handing corporates. That’s part of what she was doing at the start of 2020, as an ambassador for Our Watch, promoting the prevention of violence against women and children, both physical and psychological. She knows the topic well, of course, after a photo of her kicking a footy 13 months ago drew sexist and sexually violent abuse online. Patty Kinnersly, a Carlton board member and CEO of Our Watch, says the defiance and eloquence of Harris in that moment sparked a howl of emotion not unlike when family violence campaigner Rosie Batty first spoke after the killing of her young son in 2014. “There are things that happen in history, and capture the community in a way that we say, ‘That’s not okay.’ Tayla became the voice of a movement.” That voice, though, is subject to the staggers and silences of the fallible video conferencing platform we’re using to chat. We talk four times at the start of April, and each time she’s only just finished working out. One day it’s lifting borrowed barbells, or thrashing around on something called an assault cycle, set up in the corner of the lounge room next to her red leather couch. Another time, the online anthropomorphic torture session known as Zuu, with exercise names such as “lizard” and “gorilla”. Today, it’s conditioning: hill-climbs and 40-second sprint efforts. “Awful. Throw-up kind of awful,” she emphasises. Harris was late to our chat because of her running session, and her lightly freckled face is still flushed from exertion. “I didn’t think I’d need to shower but I was just so disgusting I had to. I wore my Costanza T-shirt for you!” (We had chatted once about Seinfeld – both big fans – so Harris donned a long-sleever with George on the front and “Can’t stand ya” on the back, in my honour.) “The one thing fighting is definitely not about – for me – is aggression. I’m better when I’m calm and calculated.” She’s remarkably upbeat in isolation, which I put down to endorphins. “I don’t just train to compete. I actually enjoy training, which makes it that much better,” she confirms. “I have no idea when I’m going to play footy again, or box again, or do anything really, but that’s okay. If it takes a long time, I’ll just continue to get ready.” Footy for Harris and likely boxing, too, won’t be back until 2021, so this star interrupted is making the most of social distancing. She’s eating the greens she hates, because she knows she has to. She’s drowning all other food in tomato sauce, because she wants to. She’s drinking her milk and watching her Love Island and walking her dog – a border collie named Beans – around her neighbourhood in suburban Strathmore, north-west of Melbourne, where she lives with her partner, Collingwood’s attacking midfielder Sarah Dargan. “There’s parks all around, and local shops down the road,” she says. “It’s a lot like where I grew up.” Harris walking her dog, Beans, around her neighbourhood. Credit:Courtesy of Lisa Harris Let’s go to where she grew up, in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. Dad Warren was a marine engineer with an enviable toolshed, and so little Tay grew up building chook pens and beehives, skateboards and jump ramps. “She had perfect timing and balance,” says Warren, who was once asked to train with Carlton and regrets turning the opportunity down. “I used to hold her by one arm in the supermarket and she’d swing around me like an orang-utan, swiping stuff from the shelves.” She was five when she played her first game of footy, with her only sibling, big brother Jack, then seven. Jack’s team was short a player, so Tay filled in and kicked six goals. She continued through junior footy with the Aspley Hornets, the only girl in a boys’ league, and at first wondered why they didn’t try harder to tackle her. Then she heard their parents on the sidelines. “Don’t touch her,” they sneered. “You’ll get into trouble!” Other times it was the opposite, the confusion of the boys bringing out their worst. “Some just wanted to smash me more,” she says, shrugging. “Which I preferred, to be honest.” She was fearless, and not just on the field, freely driving a water-skiing boat at over 100 kilometres an hour when only nine. At 12, she was rag-dolled by a bigger opponent and began boxing lessons at the local Police-Citizens Youth Club. Trained by an ex-trawlerman with an eye patch, she revelled in the discipline. Still does. “The one thing fighting is definitely not about – for me – is aggression. I’m better when I’m calm and calculated, focusing on the way your hands sit in the gloves, or the angle of your feet for a punch. Boxing is not what it seems. And I’m not what I seem.” Growing up playing junior football in Queensland with the Aspley Hornets, Harris was the only girl playing in a boys’ league. While many opponents wouldn’t go near her, “some just wanted to smash me more,” she says, “which I preferred.” Credit:Courtesy of Lisa Harris Her mum, Lisa, an insurance claims manager, says people mistakenly see her daughter as cocksure and tough. “Deep down she is really soft,” she says. “Deep down she just wants to make sure she does the right thing by everyone.” Lisa remembers how her little blonde poppet used to sprint down the hallway and leap to touch the ceiling light. Every morning at school drop-off, Mum would say the same thing to her from behind the wheel: “Bye, have a good day, be kind!” When people lack compassion or respect, Harris finds it baffling. “Bullying at school just blew my mind,” she says, throwing up her hands. “How can someone be mean to someone else? I struggled to understand it, so school was a bit of a strange time.” Harris felt different as a young girl, wearing her brother’s hand-me-downs, getting sweaty and stinky playing basketball at lunchtime. “But feeling out of place isn’t necessarily a bad thing – I didn’t feel unwanted,” she clarifies. “Yet I always felt like at footy – at a game, or training, or at the club – I was in my element. I got an extreme high from that, whereas at school I probably struggled.” She excelled at women’s football at the perfect time, joining nascent interstate competitions and playing in early televised exhibition games as a teenager, before becoming a foundation AFLW player in 2017. She’s since played in two losing grand finals (2017 and 2019) and been All Australian twice (2017 and 2018). She knows the competition intimately and offers opinions freely. The pay gap – an average AFLW salary of around $17,000 versus an average AFL salary of more than $363,000 – doesn’t stick in her craw, either. One of the major issues for AFLW players and commentators is the short length of the season (eight weeks plus finals), but Harris breaks with the majority. “If the competition suddenly went from eight games to 14 games, with the minimal preseason we’ve got, the injuries would be astronomical,” she believes. “It’s a very interesting push, to ask for that season length so soon, when we’re not ready physiologically.” The pay gap – an average AFLW salary of around $17,000 versus an average AFL salary of more than $363,000 – doesn’t stick in her craw, either. “If we were training the exact same amount of hours as men, required to eat as we’re told, have skinfolds at a certain standard, play two or three times as many games – games that are twice as long – and had all of these boundaries set, then sure. But we don’t. If we’re asked to do more as the league grows, we should get paid more, and I think we will.” Put simply, Harris has faith in those who run the league, including AFL boss Gillon McLachlan and AFLW chief Nicole Livingstone, and takes them at their word when they say the league will resume post-pandemic with all 14 AFLW teams intact. She doesn’t care what “old-mate misogynistic sexist arsehole” thinks, nor does she truck with the growing impatience of fervent AFLW boosters. “These things don’t happen in five seconds. Our product is four years old. The men’s product is more than 150 years old,” she says. “We’re the baby, just crawling. It’s exciting what could come but it won’t be coming for a long time. I think there’s a bit more patience needed in this conversation.” Flash back now to Sunday March 17, 2019, at the Whitten Oval in Melbourne’s inner west. It’s the last round of season and a stunning autumn day. Harris chats on the field with AFL chief photographer Michael Willson, who takes a happy snap of her with her parents. The game begins, and within a minute Harris plucks a mark. Willson aims his Canon 1DX Mark II and snaps a sequence: “The frame I chose – where she’s at her highest point – is just an elite, magnificent athlete in full flight, with that spectacular leg extension and elevation.” He files the pic, and posts it on his social media accounts with a caption: You kick like a girl. This photo, aka “the kick”, sparked a deluge of online abuse – but Harris turned it into a teachable moment. Credit:Getty Images Harris first saw the photo not long after the game, around 6pm, online. In her book, More than a Kick: Footy, the Photo and Me, released next week, she notes: “A kick is such an intense moment. So much focus and concentration. There’s something almost poetic about it, all that hope poured into an action. It’s like we’re all in it together … Will she? Won’t she?” She was also tagged in a Channel 7 Facebook post by friends – “Nice shot Tay” – and found her way to the comments section. They were foul. “Initially, out of interest, I kept reading, and I was like, ‘This isn’t right,’ ” she says, scratching her head. “I wasn’t emotional, but in my mind I was just thinking, ‘This isn’t what people should be allowed to say.’ ” The worst? Someone had doctored the photo to make it look as though she wasn’t wearing anything below her jumper, going so far as to paste a vulva onto the image. That photoshopped picture was then cropped twice more, becoming a twisted triptych of a naked groin. Harris sat dumbstruck. “That particular photo had hundreds of likes,” she says, shaking her head. “And that’s when I was like, ‘That’s f…ed.’ ” In response, she posted the original photo to her own accounts. On Twitter: “Here’s a picture of me at work … think about this before your derogatory comments, animals.” And on Instagram: “My hamstring is okay but derogatory and sexist comments aren’t.” Harris was far from alone at this time. Messages of support and friend requests and calls and emails and tweets and posts popped up by the thousand. The backlash was vicious. Most mainstream stories then, and now, refer to the material posted as “vile language” and “sexist abuse”, but that doesn’t convey the depth of misogyny on show. It isn’t hard to find, incidentally. Live forums still exist from that time, in which countless comments are made by anonymous posters, perhaps with a photo of the paedophile Rolf Harris as their avatar, or maybe Pepe the Frog – a cartoon avatar of the alt-right movement. Such threads begin with one bruised male ego venting about the attention lavished on a strong young woman, and the poison drips down the screen. You feel it in the guts. The following is a small sample, not even the most egregious: OMG if she thinks that is sexual assault then maybe she should be charged with public nudity for exposing herself in the first place.Unknown female gets attention, then demands more.This broad needs help. I wouldn’t go out of my way to f… that.Spreading your legs a lot isn’t kicking hard.Sticks n Stones can break bones, And Words can also Penetrate me...F… she has a good chassis.I can smell her c...Women are so retarded. Harris was far from alone at this time. Messages of support and friend requests and calls and emails and tweets and posts popped up by the thousand. She estimates the attention she received that week was 90 per cent positive, 10 per cent pathetic. Sarah Dargan sits on Tayla’s lap during one Zoom meeting and recalls the outpouring. “I couldn’t erase the comments – all I could do was make sure Tayla was okay,” Dargan says. “But people just started backing Tay and standing up. It turned good so suddenly.” (In this bright moment my wife appears over my shoulder in our lounge room, and Harris pipes up: “Hi there!” she waves. “I love these new age business meetings!”) Harris quickly owned the moment. She launched the #taylakickchallenge, for instance, offering a free pair of footy boots for the best photo mimicking her distinctive kicking action. She sought to confirm the gendered basis of the attacks, so Patty Kinnersly talked her through it: “Such abuse is meant to maintain what some men feel is their right to a position of power,” says Kinnersly. “Their view that we shouldn’t be normalising, promoting and celebrating women in public life.” She also made it clear that Harris had no responsibility whatsoever to do or say anything. “Because when you go out and proud on these things, the abuse doesn’t stop,” says Kinnersly, “it triples.” But remember, Harris is fearless. And so, on the Tuesday after the Sunday, wearing a daggy old hoodie, she did a 6am radio interview hosted by her coach, former Hawthorn player Daniel Harford. “Her ability to compartmentalise what was thrown at her, and give this composed message right between the eyes – it was remarkable,” says Harford. “When I was 21 there’s no way I would have been able to deal with what she did, with all the humility and class and polish that she showed.” Replay   She turned it into a teachable moment. Channel 7 had removed the photo from its Facebook page because of the graphic attacks, but quickly reinstated the image with an apology, in response to the message that Harris was sharing, and still shares. If organisations can employ social media editors and content producers, she says, they need to employ people to monitor material, too. “If there was graphic vile graffiti on the front of your workplace, you would remove it, straightaway. You wouldn’t be okay with leaving it there,” she explains. “They can’t just think, ‘This is the way it is.’ They need to do better.” She changed things in footy, too. Carlton’s first instinct was suppression; a club memo advised no one to comment. “I disagreed,” says Harris. “This was my moment. I felt strongly about using it to say something important.” So she organised a press conference at the club’s Ikon Park headquarters, and football united behind her. People printed T-shirts with the photo on the front, or a silhouette of the kick, or the words, YES TO GOALS, NO TO TROLLS. Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the attackers “cowardly grubs”. Interview requests came from Europe and the United States, from BBC news and The New York Times. She went global.

Credit:Getty Images “It reminded me of the way Adam Goodes spoke the day after he was racially vilified by that young girl,” says journalist Samantha Lane. “I just felt happy, and proud. I’ll declare that I like her, that I want her to excel and the AFL women’s league to become strong and more followed, but I also want it to have the kind of substance that she showed in that moment. She elevated the conversation above the sports pages.” The only hesitation in her fight was the impact it might have on others – like her mum – who struggles to forget one particular threat: “ ‘I know where you live, and I’m going to come and bleep-bleep-bleep you’ – I was horrified,” Lisa says, pausing. “How dare you? How dare you speak about my baby that way?” That week, a club security guard nicknamed Meatball walked Harris between her car and the club rooms. And then, at the preliminary final that weekend, a security detail was assigned to her parents as well. “Someone had threatened to come to the game and shoot her on the field,” says her dad, a massive man who practises Thai boxing. Instead of watching his daughter play, Warren spent the game scanning the crowd. “I can tell you, if I saw anything strange, I would have been there quicker than any security guard. And the suspicious person? They wouldn’t have survived the experience.” “I hate the thought of a young girl looking at my page and thinking, ‘I want to be like her, but if I’m like her then I’ll get comments like that.’ I wouldn’t want anything to divert her path.” Harris herself maintains that even the worst of it is “water off a duck’s back”, but Warren guesses that some of it gets through. He wonders if his girl is pulling the same trick she did in junior footy, when bigger boys would hit her hard to prove a point. “Always just brushed it off. Never let them know she was hurt.” She tells me an anecdote, from the end of that tumultuous week, and her tone is casual. But I find it profoundly sad. It’s about protecting herself online, by muting and blocking, deleting and reporting, or refraining from tagging her location. “The only thing that I changed was that I started filtering out particular words, from my comments,” she says, holding up her mobile. “I hate the thought of a young girl looking at my page and thinking, ‘I want to be like her, but if I’m like her then I’ll get comments like that.’ I wouldn’t want anything to divert her path.” And so this star of the game, still only 21 at the time, sat at home with iPhone in hand, entering the words she expects to be lobbed at her by hidden strangers:  F…. Rape. Cock. Bitch. Slut. Whore. C….  Harris poses with her statue in Melbourne's Federation Square. She knew the abuse would continue after it was unveiled. Credit:AAP When this story is printed, Tayla Harris knows she will be abused again. She has a sense for such things. She knew it in September last year, when a bronze sculpture of “the kick” by artist Terrance Plowright was unveiled in Melbourne’s Federation Square. Young, female and outspoken – moulded in metal and put on a pedestal? Yeah, she knew. “If the statue was just for my footy, of course I wouldn’t deserve it,” she says, “but it’s not about me. You could do the statue without a head for all I care. It’s about a moment.” And that moment is still with us. Ask any female journalist or politician or public figure about the abuse they receive online. Only last month, the Herald Sun decided to disallow comments on all AFLW stories, acknowledging that even the most innocuous piece could draw execrable remarks by the dozen. Harris prefers another way, tweeting that she would give up her AFLW salary to employ someone to monitor social media. “Ignoring these comments is not a solution,” she wrote. “Fight back.” Julie Inman Grant, Australia’s eSafety commissioner, is the person to pick that fight. Flying back from the US when the drama unfolded, she recalls landing in Sydney to a missed call from the Prime Minister. “That’s not normal,” she points out. “When I called back, he was really distressed about what was happening to Tayla Harris. He saw it as absolutely reprehensible, and wanted to know what we were doing.” “To me, this is just the internet surfacing the reality – and sad underbelly – of misogyny on the human condition.” For one, the government has added a new adult cyber abuse scheme to its proposed Online Safety Act, giving Inman Grant’s office stronger take-down powers, with stiffer civil penalties for non-compliance. She’s also met with Facebook, Google and Twitter about pushing platforms to make user protections simpler, to act on third-party “bystander” reports of abuse, and to invest in artificial intelligence to detect and remove abusive content. A new Women Influencing Tech Spaces program is helping females with “social media self-defence training”, and discussions are underway with the AFL about a joint effort to counter online vilification. Employing more moderators is great, Inman Grant says, but you’re still playing a game of “whack-a-mole”, and not facing the core issue, which is societal. “To me, this is just the internet surfacing the reality – and sad underbelly – of misogyny on the human condition. There’s a longer-term cultural and behavioural issue we need to tackle.” That’s why Harris wrote her book. For the past year, people have been asking her for advice. More than a Kick is aimed at young readers, and deals with everything from sarcastic comments and fake friends to teenage anxiety about which pictures to post. There are tips on how to disagree politely, and how to stay safe. Of course, this crusade is only part of her brand, and in some ways its seriousness misrepresents her personality. The Harris I meet is funny and silly, spontaneous and carefree, a young woman who books flights without a return leg and freely admits she barely reads books. She’s Generation Z, with #nofilter. “She is who she is. She’s totally Insta,” says Sam Lane. “But she’s also really strategic. I met her when she was 20 years old, and even then she was seeing herself on a global stage.” Her brand is building. Nike sponsors her boots and runners. Dandenong Hyundai keeps her in a fresh set of wheels. She does junior coaching with Carlton’s Next Generation Academy, and has financial advisers to manage investment properties in Brisbane and Melbourne, and diversify her share portfolio. A deal with Colgate was signed this month, and the services group MC Labour has the naming rights to her boxing shorts (which she designed, with sequins and tassels). She recently trademarked her boxing logo – TH with a lightning bolt in the centre – and after lengthy negotiations Harris has permission to use the kick photo (owned by the AFL) to sell T-shirts with its silhouette online. Could that distinctive outline become her version of the iconic Michael Jordan “Jumpman” logo for an apparel range? “That’s in conversation,” says Saundry, her manager. “We’ve just gotta find a way to make something work.” Harris tackles Justine Mules of the Adelaide Crows during the Round 4 AFLW match at Richmond Oval in Adelaide, March 1, 2020. Credit:AAP Harris has an acting agent, too, and takes classes and workshops, knowing she will be called on for public speaking, and perhaps for roles in sports media. She looks up to the commercial success of mixed martial arts fighter and celebrity Rhonda Rousey, and lives by one of the brawler’s aspirational aphorisms: “If you can’t dream big, ridiculous dreams, what’s the point of dreaming at all?” Hopefully, amid all of this image curation, she remains unvarnished. Harris is at that age when star athletes often begin to sense their worth and clam up, offering only rare peeks into their  authenticity. Current evidence is – thankfully – to the contrary. In a post-match interview this season, an AFLW opponent said that if you nullify Harris in the air, she’s “useless” on the ground. Harris played to the theatre of the moment on Instagram, posting a photo of an apex predator with a glowing golden mane and these words: “A lion never loses sleep over the opinions of sheep.” In isolation, she’s also decided to take up a YouTube career, filming and editing a library of entertaining videos in which she chats about her life, or takes people through a workout. I had wanted to ask her about her tattoos, and her catalogue of ink is one of the first topics addressed on camera. It’s hard to know where Harris will end up. She certainly has no grand plan. She won’t even lock herself into footy. Messages of love from her mum and dad on the inside of either wrist. The heads of the four main characters in Seinfeld – Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine – on a forearm, even though she wasn’t born until 1997, eight years after the show premiered in 1989. “Fortune favours the brave” on the inside of her right elbow. The Buddhist symbol for enlightenment on her left thumb. “Lines, triangles, dots,” she says. “I just like shapes.” On one bum cheek, a picture of Judge Judy and the words “Only Judy can judge me.” And on the other cheek? A quote from Kris Jenner, offered to Kim Kardashian when she was doing a nude photo shoot: “You’re doing amazing sweetie.” She pulls down her bottom lip, and on the skin inside is a tattoo she got at Bondi Beach, one word in capital letters: STRAYA. When Harris interlocks her fingers, the middle knuckles line up to spell OXYMORON. “I play two sports that are dominated by men, one you think of as a blood sport. But in reality I hate hurting people, physically or emotionally,” she says. “It’s not in me to actually want to inflict pain. That’s the oxymoron – I’m the opposite of what I do.” Harris and partner Sarah Dargan at the 2019 Brownlow awards. On her future in the AFLW competition, she says: “The second I don’t want to be there, I won’t be. I don’t think you should do something that doesn’t make you happy.” Credit:Getty Images She is growing into herself as a player, too. Although she is the best contested mark in the league, and probably the longest kick, she played a more selfless role for her teammates this year, focusing on goal assists more than goals, and “halving” marking contests rather than always taking the big screamer. She’s not without quirks or fallibility. “Definitely messy!” says Dargan. “Every time she goes away, I clean the house. The minute she’s back, the suitcase hits the floor and she lives out of it for days. She’ll eat a Kit Kat and throw the rubbish on the floor.” Bizarrely, she won’t listen to music in the car – a safety measure she learnt from her dad. “It has to be silent, and it’s sooo boring. And awkward.” A big part of Saundry’s job is making sure Harris remains wild but doesn’t exhaust herself. “You want her to publicise the competition, but not carry the competition,” says Saundry, who once managed AFLW commentator and star Daisy Pearce. “Daisy carried the competition, and the amount of stress it put her under – I’d never want to see another athlete feel that obligation on her shoulders.” It’s hard to know where Harris will end up. She certainly has no grand plan. She won’t even lock herself into footy. She finds it “interesting” that fans are so emotionally invested, because she was never that way. Harris loves kicking and marking but acknowledges that kicking and marking is all it is. Some people suspect that, if some other challenge appealed to her more, she would drop the game. “That is accurate,” she says, pulling her hair back into that single taut ponytail she favours when running or kicking or punching. “The second I don’t want to be there, I won’t be. I don’t think you should do something that doesn’t make you happy. In my life, I come first.” 1800 RESPECT: 1800 737 732.

43,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/the-untold-grief-tupperware-has-brought-to-my-marriage-20200316-p54akz.html,The untold grief Tupperware has brought to my marriage,"For fans of Tupperware, the party never ends – it's trying to keep a lid on arguments about how to stack it that can bring on the hangover. By Tim Elliott There are so many wonderful parts to being married that I don’t know where to start. So I might as well start with the Tupperware. Like most families, we have a dedicated drawer for Tupperware (which is how we refer to all the plastic containers in it). It’s in the kitchen, right next to the fridge. The drawer must have at least 100 pieces in it, from the shallow rectangular containers in which we keep leftover stir-fry to tall tube-shaped ones that are just perfect for opened packets of spaghetti. There are also some cute little containers with colourful lids that we used when our daughters were babies and which we haven’t had the heart to throw out. When Tupperware was first launched, sales were dismal, until selling it at  home parties was introduced.Credit:Getty Images I have a lot of negative emotions towards some of these containers, either because their lids don’t quite fit or they don’t have a lid or because they keep hanging around in the drawer, like zombie Tupperware, even though I could swear I threw them out three weeks ago. But there are other pieces that I am very fond of indeed. They are my go-to pieces, such as the one that snugly fits the sandwich I take to work every day. You may be shaking your head right now and thinking “The author of this article needs therapy,” but if you were honest with yourself, you’d admit to having a favourite item of Tupperware, too. Tupperware takes its name from its inventor, Earl Silas Tupper. Born in 1907, in New Hampshire, Tupper was an inveterate tinkerer who kept notebooks full of obscure inventions, including a fish-powered boat and pants that wouldn’t lose their crease. In 1937, he got a job at DuPont, the chemical company, where he experimented with unbreakable cups and plastic cigarette cases. After World War II, he began developing a line of airtight plastic containers that would keep food fresh, using what would later become his patented “burping” seal. In 1948, he introduced his Tupperware range to department stores, but sales were dismal, so, with the help of a single mother named Brownie Wise, he began selling them at home parties. Tupper was a visionary, no doubt about it. He got to retire at 51, by which time his products had been recognised not only for their seamless functionality but for their beauty, with items being collected regularly by the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. According to something I read, which admittedly sounds like complete bullshit, there is a Tupperware party being hosted every 2.5 seconds somewhere in the world. But what Tupper could never have anticipated is the untold grief his products and their unending replicas have brought to my marriage. The problem has to do with how to pack the drawer. Packing a Tupperware drawer properly is important, because it allows you to identify and access items – such as that favourite one for my work sandwich – with a minimum of fuss. Once your 14-year-old daughter says, “Actually Dad, Mum is right,” it’s game over. But my wife and I have different styles. For example, she puts the lids on each individual container before stacking them one upon the other. I, on the other hand, get all the similarly sized containers and nest them within one another, like a Russian Tupperware doll, then lie all the lids on top. Because the containers fit neatly into one another, this saves a lot of space. I don’t want to diss my wife or cast aspersions on her judgment, but you’d have to be a mental defective not to see that my technique is better than hers. Yet if I pack it my way, she’ll open the drawer, look inside, and throw her arms up. “Oh my god!” she’ll say, rolling her eyes so much they look like they could fly right out of her head. “It’s happened again! Someone has failed to pack the Tupperware the right way! How many times do I have to blah blah blah …” At this point, I will walk over, gesture towards the drawer and explain my thinking. But of course, she is familiar with my reasoning, and rebuts it forcefully, and with a conviction I can’t match.

44,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/the-untold-grief-tupperware-has-brought-to-my-marriage-20200316-p54akz.html,The untold grief Tupperware has brought to my marriage,"For fans of Tupperware, the party never ends – it's trying to keep a lid on arguments about how to stack it that can bring on the hangover. By Tim Elliott There are so many wonderful parts to being married that I don’t know where to start. So I might as well start with the Tupperware. Like most families, we have a dedicated drawer for Tupperware (which is how we refer to all the plastic containers in it). It’s in the kitchen, right next to the fridge. The drawer must have at least 100 pieces in it, from the shallow rectangular containers in which we keep leftover stir-fry to tall tube-shaped ones that are just perfect for opened packets of spaghetti. There are also some cute little containers with colourful lids that we used when our daughters were babies and which we haven’t had the heart to throw out. When Tupperware was first launched, sales were dismal, until selling it at  home parties was introduced.Credit:Getty Images I have a lot of negative emotions towards some of these containers, either because their lids don’t quite fit or they don’t have a lid or because they keep hanging around in the drawer, like zombie Tupperware, even though I could swear I threw them out three weeks ago. But there are other pieces that I am very fond of indeed. They are my go-to pieces, such as the one that snugly fits the sandwich I take to work every day. You may be shaking your head right now and thinking “The author of this article needs therapy,” but if you were honest with yourself, you’d admit to having a favourite item of Tupperware, too. Tupperware takes its name from its inventor, Earl Silas Tupper. Born in 1907, in New Hampshire, Tupper was an inveterate tinkerer who kept notebooks full of obscure inventions, including a fish-powered boat and pants that wouldn’t lose their crease. In 1937, he got a job at DuPont, the chemical company, where he experimented with unbreakable cups and plastic cigarette cases. After World War II, he began developing a line of airtight plastic containers that would keep food fresh, using what would later become his patented “burping” seal. In 1948, he introduced his Tupperware range to department stores, but sales were dismal, so, with the help of a single mother named Brownie Wise, he began selling them at home parties. Tupper was a visionary, no doubt about it. He got to retire at 51, by which time his products had been recognised not only for their seamless functionality but for their beauty, with items being collected regularly by the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. According to something I read, which admittedly sounds like complete bullshit, there is a Tupperware party being hosted every 2.5 seconds somewhere in the world. But what Tupper could never have anticipated is the untold grief his products and their unending replicas have brought to my marriage. The problem has to do with how to pack the drawer. Packing a Tupperware drawer properly is important, because it allows you to identify and access items – such as that favourite one for my work sandwich – with a minimum of fuss. Once your 14-year-old daughter says, “Actually Dad, Mum is right,” it’s game over. But my wife and I have different styles. For example, she puts the lids on each individual container before stacking them one upon the other. I, on the other hand, get all the similarly sized containers and nest them within one another, like a Russian Tupperware doll, then lie all the lids on top. Because the containers fit neatly into one another, this saves a lot of space. I don’t want to diss my wife or cast aspersions on her judgment, but you’d have to be a mental defective not to see that my technique is better than hers. Yet if I pack it my way, she’ll open the drawer, look inside, and throw her arms up. “Oh my god!” she’ll say, rolling her eyes so much they look like they could fly right out of her head. “It’s happened again! Someone has failed to pack the Tupperware the right way! How many times do I have to blah blah blah …” At this point, I will walk over, gesture towards the drawer and explain my thinking. But of course, she is familiar with my reasoning, and rebuts it forcefully, and with a conviction I can’t match. She is a lawyer, after all, and has perfected a way of sounding like she is correct even when she is patently incorrect. At this point, I bring out the sarcasm: “Okay, so when did you do your MBA in Tupperware management?” But this is taking the low road, and both she and I know it. Then the kids get involved. The trouble with this is that kids have zero integrity. They will side with whichever parent has been nicest to them most recently. It’s a lottery. But it doesn’t matter.

Fifty years later, they still live a “terrific” life – even after a devastating diagnosis in 2015.  John and Cathy Roth: ""I’ve always fought against things in life and he’s taught me acceptance. Just being together we’re happy. And if and when I don’t have him, I’ve got the most amazing memories.""Credit:Eddie Jim CATHY: I met John when I was a radiographer at Melbourne’s St Vincent’s Hospital and he was a med student; he had these deep, caring eyes. Later we worked at the same hospital in Geelong. We talked until the wee hours at a party in January 1970 and were engaged in May. Everyone said, “This is ridiculous, it won’t last,” and here we are 50 years later. John still tells me 100 times a day that he loves me. He has not had one day off work in his life. When he had knee surgery in the late 1980s, he operated that day, had his knee operated on late that afternoon, stayed in hospital overnight, then did a ward round on crutches the next morning. The only times we argued were over him not being at concerts and things for the kids. He came home late one night when the children were small and I had them lined up in their pyjamas. I said, “Children, this is your father. John, meet your children.” At one stage, we had three children under three. That was challenging. We went to England in 1977 for two years when the youngest was three and they were some of the happiest times. We were so poor, but we did things as a family, like make snowmen in the backyard. The hardest time was in the late 1980s and early ’90s: John was travelling with work, his parents both had Alzheimer’s, my father had just passed away and my mother had renal failure. The children were at school and I was working, running the function centre we bought. I was pulled in 10,000 ways. When his parents had Alzheimer’s, John said, “I’m doomed,” and that got me mad because I’m a fighter. That’s why I set up PALZ [Professionals with Alzheimer’s]. From John’s late 50s onwards, I’d tell him things and he’d say, “You didn’t tell me that!” I thought, “Maybe I’m going batty.” The formal diagnosis was mid-2015. His head dropped; it was the fulfilment of his worst fears. He left work that day. I was broken-hearted. I am still. It’s such a cruel and undignified death sentence, because it strips a person of their amazingness. You want to shout to the world, “The person I see is caring, beautiful, intelligent – and you’re pitying them! How dare you?” It has made me more protective, which has altered the relationship. You’re no longer working as two halves of a whole. His whole life was one of pain. He started off in refugee camps with his Hungarian family in World War II, then went to boarding school at the age of 10 and only saw his parents once a year [as his father was a surgeon in what was then New Guinea]. So I wanted to protect him from any more. The care is 24/7. There isn’t a moment when you don’t worry. If he goes out, how do I find him? I’m a great believer in personal space and I miss it. So I tend to work at 3am on PALZ while also studying for my master’s degree in leadership. “We’ve been saying ‘Ilyop’ to each other forever. It stands for ‘I love you, Pop’ – that’s short for Poppet.” Every so often I get down, but I don’t allow myself to stay there. When he was diagnosed, he said to a friend, “I’m not concerned for me. I’m heartbroken for Cathy.” So I can’t let him down. He’s my soul mate. I get such love from him. And he still does really good foot massages. I’ve always fought against things in life and he’s taught me acceptance. Just being together we’re happy. And if and when I don’t have him, I’ve got the most amazing memories. JOHN: I was drawn to Cathy the moment I saw her. I fell head over heels. She went to England to work [two months after the party] and I asked her to come back. I rang and said, “I think we should tie the knot.” I was attracted to her nature; she’s a beautiful person. If any of her friends need help, she’ll drop everything and say, “I’ll help you get through it.” We’ve been saying “Ilyop” to each other forever. It stands for “I love you, Pop” – that’s short for Poppet. It’s a little something between us. I adore Cathy and it might sound crazy, but I say it all the time. She’s my little Pop. She did it tough when the kids were young. She was in hospital for weeks with every baby, with [the potentially life-threatening conditions of] pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. I had to sit exams to qualify for the college of surgeons and she took a large load, doing everything with the kids while I studied. I was working ridiculous hours – 18 hours a day as a general surgeon – and I’d come home tired and grumpy. I’d go into my little cave and she’d say to the kids, “Dad’s been working hard. Don’t disturb him.” I knew I’d get Alzheimer’s. You forget a hell of a lot of things and you become irritable. There are times when I’m quite lucid, but other times when I muck things up. You have arguments: “I told you to do this” and then, “No you didn’t.” I irritate Cath, but she’s got an enormous amount of tolerance. She makes me do puzzles because of my brain not being as good as it used to be. When I was diagnosed, I was on anti-depressants, but now I’m calm and collected. I’ve learnt to work alongside it and I’m quite happy; I don’t get upset about things easily any more. I can sleep well at night. I had to leave work and I took that, but with a lot of grief. I loved operating and all the guys I used to mix with – and all of that has gone. PALZ is Cathy’s baby – she set it up – and I got involved in medical research because I wanted to help work out this stupid disease. Most people in my position would probably be ashamed and not see anybody. You get a label, but if you can control yourself and entertain yourself with other activities, you can still lead a reasonably good life. Cathy and I enjoy each other’s company. We enjoy the kids and the littlies [the couple have nine grandchildren], and in that regard we have a terrific life. If she wants a foot massage, I’m her man. I love her even more than I did 50 years ago. She’s the love of my life. To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.

47,/politics/federal/morrison-says-coronavirus-app-data-will-be-kept-in-australia-20200424-p54n28.html,Morrison says coronavirus app data will be kept in Australia,"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has given assurances data collected from the coronavirus contact tracing app will be kept in Australia, batting away concerns it could be collected by United States' law enforcement agencies. Mr Morrison said information collected by the app, which will use American company Amazon to host sensitive data, will be stored in Australia. Labor fears data collected by the coronavirus app could be accessed by US law enforcement. Credit:AAP ""The server is in Australia and it's using Amazon Web Services, who work with Australia on many, many sensitive issues in terms of Australia's data management,"" the Prime Minister said. ""It's a nationally encrypted data store."" The app will collect users' names, mobile phone, postcode and rough date of birth in order to automate the contact tracing regime that helps quickly lock down the close contacts of positive coronavirus cases. Labor health spokesman Chris Bowen and Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said their concerns about foreign access were yet to be fully addressed, and called on the government to share more information about how United States and Australian security laws interact. ""The government must also urgently explain why the data collected from Australian app users will reportedly be stored on servers hosted by Amazon - a foreign company,"" the two senior Labor members said in an op-ed published in The Australian. ""On the face of it, the inexplicable decision to award the storage contract to a US company (overlooking Australian companies already security cleared for just such a role) could mean that the personal information of Australian app users could be accessed by US law enforcement agencies,"" they wrote. Mr Morrison urged Australians to download the app, saying it would help states and territories relax lockdown laws. ""It will be illegal for information to go out of that data store to any other person other than that for whom the whole thing is designed, and that is to support the health worker in the state to be able to undertake the contact tracing."" Labor maintains in-principle support for the app but has urged the security matters to be clarified before the mid-May sitting week, where the federal government has pledged to introduce new laws to address fears the app could be accessed not just by other countries, but by Australia's own law enforcement agencies without a warrant under controversial encryption laws passed in 2018.

In a sign of the trouble facing Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, the budget bottom line deteriorated by almost $7.5 billion in the month as the government's key revenue streams started to dry up. Treasurer Josh FrydenbergCredit:Alex Ellinghausen Finance Department figures released on Friday showed that at the end of March the budget was showing a deficit of $22.4 billion. To meet the government's planned $5 billion surplus for the 2019-20 financial year, the budget was supposed to show a $12.5 billion deficit at that point of the year. Personal income tax collections were $1 billion behind schedule at the end of the month. That pre-dates the major lift in unemployment that occurred through the last week of March and early April which will hit income collection levels. Of more concern, company tax collections were almost $4 billion behind their expected level at less than $65 billion. At the end of February, company tax collections were $2 billion short of forecasts. The hit to equity markets that started in late February is now evident. Superannuation taxes were 11 per cent down on forecast. There was some upside for the government with GST revenues in front of projections by $900 million but this was down on the $1.1 billion recorded to the end of February. All the extra spending the government is introducing to stabilise the economy has yet to flow through to the official budget figures. But social security and welfare spending, at the three-quarter mark of the financial year, is ahead of where it should be for March. Mr Frydenberg has pushed back the budget until October. Private sector economists are expecting the expected surplus to become a deficit of at least $60 billion. The 2020-21 forecast surplus of $6.1 billion is tipped to be a record deficit of up to $100 billion. Apart from the headline deterioration in the budget through March, other key fiscal measures have gone backward. Net debt is now at $429 billion, having gone backward by $5 billion in March while total liabilities increased by $15 billion to more than $1.2 trillion. Even the value of government assets fell through March. One of the nation's most respected market economists, Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans, said the government should be in no rush to repair the budget even if it puts the nation's triple A credit rating at risk. He said the Reserve Bank was likely to hold official interest rates at their current record low of 0.25 per cent until at least 2023. Tightening the budget, even if it only meant smaller deficits rather than a rush back into surplus, would keep unemployment elevated and hurt the overall economy. Mr Evans said the jobs market's pre-coronavirus issues of high under-employment, slow wages growth and pressure on household incomes would remain after the virus had passed. ""The aftermath of a global recession; damaged business balance sheets; and a sustained fall in permanent immigration are all formidable headwinds for the economy,"" he said. ""These will superimpose on the difficulties which were faced by the economy before the current crisis."" Shane is a senior economics correspondent for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

Mr Evans said the jobs market's pre-coronavirus issues of high under-employment, slow wages growth and pressure on household incomes would remain after the virus had passed. ""The aftermath of a global recession; damaged business balance sheets; and a sustained fall in permanent immigration are all formidable headwinds for the economy,"" he said. ""These will superimpose on the difficulties which were faced by the economy before the current crisis."" Shane is a senior economics correspondent for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

The federal government, under pressure from small businesses who have struck problems with the $130 billion scheme, has worked with the nation's banks to create hotlines so firms can quickly access loans to cover their staff salaries. Tammy Robinson, manager at the FCGC gym, one of many businesses trying to find tens of thousands of dollars to pay its staff the JobKeeper payment. Credit:Eddie Jim JobKeeper is the government's most important coronavirus stimulus measure, paying $1500 of eligible workers' wages in a program it says will ensure employees retain a connection to their employers. Under the scheme, businesses have to pay their staff wages before being reimbursed by the government through the Tax Office. Replay   The flat $1500-a-fortnight rate means about 1.7 million part-time and casual workers will get a pay rise, putting pressures on businesses to cover their inflated wage bill so they can access JobKeeper. FCGC Gymnastics, a community gym for people of all ages and abilities in Melbourne, is struggling to find enough money to cover its JobKeeper wage bill. About half of its staff normally earn less than $500 a fortnight. Now those workers, many of whom are 16-year-olds teaching one junior gymnastics class a week, will be entitled to $1500. ""One of them is my son, he's a great kid, but I'm a little uncomfortable with him getting $18,000 for six months,"" the gym's operations manager Tammy Robinson said. ""$18,000 for a 16-year-old is a lot of money."" The requirement to pay a flat $1500 has almost doubled FCGC's wage bill to about $60,000 a fortnight at a time when the not-for-profit gym isn't taking in any money because of social distancing rules. Ms Robinson is negotiating with banks for a loan — on which the gym will have to pay interest — to cover its up front JobKeeper payments but is desperately worried about what will happen if she cannot secure one. ""That's the scary thought. That's what we don't want to think about,"" she said. As JobKeeper has to be paid to most workers each fortnight but the Tax Office only repays employers monthly, the gym will have to find $120,000. In August, when the dates align so that there are three ""JobKeeper fortnights"" in the one month it will need to find an additional $60,000. When the tax office pays an employer for the past month they will have to use that money to start paying for the month ahead. ""You're filling one hole with the dirt from another,"" one payroll industry source said. The issue has been generating concern within the government backbench as many businesses have complained their banks are backlogged processing loan applications. There have also been complaints about restrictions to the scheme including on partnerships and trusts. Nine hundred thousand firms expressed interest in JobKeeper after it was announced. So far, 275,000 have submitted formal applications, of which half are sole traders. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday revealed special hotlines will be created so businesses seeking JobKeeper support can get help from their banks.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the requirement of businesses to cover wages up-front was an integrity feature of the JobKeeper system. On Thursday he announced the major banks would set up hotlines businesses can call to have their loan applications expedited so they can pay JobKeeper up front. ""Go to your bank, ring their hotline, ask for that support and the support will be forthcoming,"" Mr Frydenberg said. The government has told banks to process applications faster and help customers in need. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was concerned about the difficulties facing businesses accessing the cash required to cover their wage bills. ""It's important that banks stay up to the mark here,"" Mr Morrison said.

The airline's directors put the company into administration this week after it failed to pull off a restructure. Virgin, like airlines around the world, has shut down the vast majority of air travel as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions. The administrators are now working hard on finding new owners for  Virgin and have said at least 10 groups are interested in being a part of the rebirth of the airline. Private equity group BGH Capital is in the race, while transport billionaire Lindsay Fox has also been mentioned as a possible bidder, along with various international interests. The carrier appointed administrators on Tuesday after being unable to broker a deal with the government. Credit:James Alcock The new figures were made available in court documents filed by Virgin's administrators at Deloitte ahead of a Federal Court hearing on Friday to discuss minor elements of the administration. The report shows that administrators have identified 10,247 known creditors in total (including approximately 9020 employees). ""This is likely to change as more information becomes available. The administrators expect the total number of creditors is estimated to be over 12,000,"" the documents signed by Deloitte partner and Virgin administrator Vaughan Strawbridge said. Virgin employs about 10,000 staff and according to the court documents they are estimated to be owed approximately $450.77 million. The breakdown also shows that Virgin's increasingly angry bondholders who expect to be asked to take the biggest haircut will rank just behind secured lenders in terms of the value of their claims with secured lenders and secured leaseholders owed $2.28 billion and bondholders $1.98 billion. Other financing groups providing credit for Virgin to lease aircraft are owed $1.88 billion. Trade creditors, ie people who supply services or goods to Virgin, are owed about $166.7 million while landlords are estimated to be owed $71.21 million. The court documents also show the administrators face a growing issue with working through the company's aircraft leases. ""Reaching a determination as to the future status of the leases and identifying any further arrangements that may be relevant has been since their appointment, and will continue to be, a very significant task for the administrators,"" Mr Strawbridge said. Replay   In administration, Deloitte acts as an independent party to assess Virgin’s position and negotiate with creditors about the best outcome for the business. That could include finding new owners to take over the airline and keep it operating or, if that is not possible, selling its remaining assets to pay off as many creditors as possible.

57,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/home-school-of-hard-knocks-the-diary-of-a-wfh-mother-20200407-p54hto.html,Home school of hard knocks: the diary of a WFH mother,"The laborious lockdown means children are being taught by their parents – who are learning just as much as their young charges. By Amanda Hooton Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  Education is an admirable thing. But it is well to remember, from time to time, that nothing worth knowing can be taught. - Oscar Wilde 0500 hours: The era of acronyms is upon us: our family’s first day of WFH (working from home) with CAH (child at home). My partner and I get up at 5am to get a head-start on (paid) work before child gets up. Start typing. 0520: Seven-year-old daughter, the Primary Schooler, is woken by the cat and gets up. Stop typing. 0525: Not the cat, as it turns out. Nits. Here’s another acronym: WTF. No work possible until 0900, when our school program, drafted on the kitchen table last night, takes effect. Spend intervening hours doing nit treatment, making school lunch in attempt to maintain order and routine (VIP, according to Google home-schooling advice), and attempting to create enticing classroom environment using Primary Schooler’s very low desk and tiny kid’s chairs. Realise I will be performing all new duties as high-powered teaching professional while sitting only 30 centimetres from the floor. 0855: Primary Schooler attempts to log on to Mathletics on her father’s phone. Drops phone, smashes screen. Home schooling begins. The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet. - Aristotle It is a function of adulthood, I suppose, to simultaneously feel that childhood occurred a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and also that our seven-year-old selves are right beside us, breathing heavily down our necks. I am amazed, in our first days of home schooling, at how fresh the emotional freight of education is: as if my long-ago feelings about the times tables (terrible) and Milly Molly Mandy (excellent) have all been perfectly preserved under the pack ice of increasing years, ready to be cracked free by the pick-axe of my own child. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  During these first home-schooling days, I can feel my stomach muscles clenched with anxiety as the Primary Schooler completes her “Bridging to Ten” maths worksheets; my desperate focus on getting the mental maths answers correct (4 + 9 = … 13!). The Primary Schooler, conversely, has the attention span of a gnat, and a kind of sunny confidence unrelated to performance that I find both awe-inspiring and annoying. Lunchtimes bring more revelations.One: who knew she ate at 11.30? Two: who knew she ate a single bite of everything in her lunchbox before finishing anything? Three: who knew her favourite number was four; or that she understood onomatopoeia; or that she’s obsessed with Irish dancing? I thought I knew her absolutely – the privilege of being a small child’s parent – yet here she is, already living a life beyond my influence. Irish dancing! I feel like my own mother, who still remembers the first time I poked my tongue out at her; not because it was naughty, but because it was something I hadn’t learnt from her. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  1300: See Primary Schooler’s friend and mother at park. Primary schoolers fall rapturously into each other’s arms before we can stop them; mother and I discuss (at great distance and high volume) our worries about our own educational failures being horribly exposed: mother has just completed a shoelace-tying competition with her two children in which she came last. Her plan for this arvo is to teach children to make a gin and tonic. Can this be considered a core learning outcome? On reflection, if it comes to choice of life skills – bridging to 10 or mixing a perfect drink – the answer is yes.   I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious. - Albert Einstein By the middle of week two, my new big worry is not educational but technological incompetence. Is the Primary Schooler’s learning being compromised because I’m not on top of social media? This seems insane, and yet the other day all her little mates were “bear hunting” around the neighbourhood – searching for teddy bears in people’s windows – and she was not, because I’m not on Facebook and didn’t know what the hell was going on. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  I feel devastated by this, but she sails serenely on. The Irish dancing obsession continues: she’s somehow discovered that competitors glue their socks to their calves, which she finds mind-boggling (as do I, to be honest); she spends every spare moment leaping heavily around the sitting room with her arms clenched to her sides. This is, at least, proof of Einstein’s theory: an ounce of passionate curiosity outweighs a pound of rote learning. It’s clear she knows far more about the slip jig than the three times table. Meanwhile, back online, it’s also clear that home schooling – which, by definition, occurs at home, out of the public eye – has nonetheless become a whole new forum for competitive parenting. No sooner do you let your kid spend half an hour watching nit videos (broadly educational, right?) than you find someone, somewhere, recounting their virtual tour of MOMA with their five-year-old. The whole thing is utterly exhausting. All this, and work, too. (Remember work?) I find myself longing for some of this “unbearable-tedium-of-lockdown” I keep hearing about. I’m either teaching or working or feeling stricken with guilt; there is no tedium. 2130: Still trying to organise tomorrow. Have arranged Zoom violin lesson; pressed flowers for art project collage; cleaned up the detritus from “Will it Float, Sink or Dissolve?” science experiment. Trying to organise worksheet printing when suddenly hear rhythmic hacking noise behind me. Turning, I see cat about to vomit on sitting-room carpet. Run frantically towards her. She vanishes into the night, leaving trail of vomit out the back door. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  Enter bedroom/corporate office suite, where partner is working post-childcare. Me: “The cat has vomited.” Him (horrified): “What?!” Me: “But it missed the carpet. It’s only on the tiles.” Him: “Well, that’s a win.” Clean up vomit, reflecting on new life in which vomit only on the tiles is a win. There’s a lesson in that, I’m sure. But I don’t know what it is. You live and learn. Well, at any rate, you live. - Douglas Adams Week three begins with the Primary Schooler bouncing into the bedroom while I’m still asleep. “I’ve lost my knick!” she announces. “Your what?” I ask, rearing upright.“My knick. My knick of Irish dancing.” Later, I finally realise: there is a knack to worksheets. They are not intended as a proof of my child’s perfection, and therefore my own educational and maternal brilliance. They are a chance for her to learn. Am totally ashamed to say this comes as a revelation. And bizarrely, makes me far less worried about doing them. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  1200: Primary Schooler spends afternoon with her father and I doing basic carpentry, making bridal couple from paper cups, painting fairy mushroom house, and going on long bike ride to a park where she makes a model boat for the pond. In the late afternoon, we go for an ice-cream. En route, we play I Spy. Me: “Something beginning with NP” (number plate).

By Amanda Hooton Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  Education is an admirable thing. But it is well to remember, from time to time, that nothing worth knowing can be taught. - Oscar Wilde 0500 hours: The era of acronyms is upon us: our family’s first day of WFH (working from home) with CAH (child at home). My partner and I get up at 5am to get a head-start on (paid) work before child gets up. Start typing. 0520: Seven-year-old daughter, the Primary Schooler, is woken by the cat and gets up. Stop typing. 0525: Not the cat, as it turns out. Nits. Here’s another acronym: WTF. No work possible until 0900, when our school program, drafted on the kitchen table last night, takes effect. Spend intervening hours doing nit treatment, making school lunch in attempt to maintain order and routine (VIP, according to Google home-schooling advice), and attempting to create enticing classroom environment using Primary Schooler’s very low desk and tiny kid’s chairs. Realise I will be performing all new duties as high-powered teaching professional while sitting only 30 centimetres from the floor. 0855: Primary Schooler attempts to log on to Mathletics on her father’s phone. Drops phone, smashes screen. Home schooling begins. The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet. - Aristotle It is a function of adulthood, I suppose, to simultaneously feel that childhood occurred a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and also that our seven-year-old selves are right beside us, breathing heavily down our necks. I am amazed, in our first days of home schooling, at how fresh the emotional freight of education is: as if my long-ago feelings about the times tables (terrible) and Milly Molly Mandy (excellent) have all been perfectly preserved under the pack ice of increasing years, ready to be cracked free by the pick-axe of my own child. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  During these first home-schooling days, I can feel my stomach muscles clenched with anxiety as the Primary Schooler completes her “Bridging to Ten” maths worksheets; my desperate focus on getting the mental maths answers correct (4 + 9 = … 13!). The Primary Schooler, conversely, has the attention span of a gnat, and a kind of sunny confidence unrelated to performance that I find both awe-inspiring and annoying. Lunchtimes bring more revelations.One: who knew she ate at 11.30? Two: who knew she ate a single bite of everything in her lunchbox before finishing anything? Three: who knew her favourite number was four; or that she understood onomatopoeia; or that she’s obsessed with Irish dancing? I thought I knew her absolutely – the privilege of being a small child’s parent – yet here she is, already living a life beyond my influence. Irish dancing! I feel like my own mother, who still remembers the first time I poked my tongue out at her; not because it was naughty, but because it was something I hadn’t learnt from her. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  1300: See Primary Schooler’s friend and mother at park. Primary schoolers fall rapturously into each other’s arms before we can stop them; mother and I discuss (at great distance and high volume) our worries about our own educational failures being horribly exposed: mother has just completed a shoelace-tying competition with her two children in which she came last. Her plan for this arvo is to teach children to make a gin and tonic. Can this be considered a core learning outcome? On reflection, if it comes to choice of life skills – bridging to 10 or mixing a perfect drink – the answer is yes.   I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious. - Albert Einstein By the middle of week two, my new big worry is not educational but technological incompetence. Is the Primary Schooler’s learning being compromised because I’m not on top of social media? This seems insane, and yet the other day all her little mates were “bear hunting” around the neighbourhood – searching for teddy bears in people’s windows – and she was not, because I’m not on Facebook and didn’t know what the hell was going on. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  I feel devastated by this, but she sails serenely on. The Irish dancing obsession continues: she’s somehow discovered that competitors glue their socks to their calves, which she finds mind-boggling (as do I, to be honest); she spends every spare moment leaping heavily around the sitting room with her arms clenched to her sides. This is, at least, proof of Einstein’s theory: an ounce of passionate curiosity outweighs a pound of rote learning. It’s clear she knows far more about the slip jig than the three times table. Meanwhile, back online, it’s also clear that home schooling – which, by definition, occurs at home, out of the public eye – has nonetheless become a whole new forum for competitive parenting. No sooner do you let your kid spend half an hour watching nit videos (broadly educational, right?) than you find someone, somewhere, recounting their virtual tour of MOMA with their five-year-old. The whole thing is utterly exhausting. All this, and work, too. (Remember work?) I find myself longing for some of this “unbearable-tedium-of-lockdown” I keep hearing about. I’m either teaching or working or feeling stricken with guilt; there is no tedium. 2130: Still trying to organise tomorrow. Have arranged Zoom violin lesson; pressed flowers for art project collage; cleaned up the detritus from “Will it Float, Sink or Dissolve?” science experiment. Trying to organise worksheet printing when suddenly hear rhythmic hacking noise behind me. Turning, I see cat about to vomit on sitting-room carpet. Run frantically towards her. She vanishes into the night, leaving trail of vomit out the back door. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  Enter bedroom/corporate office suite, where partner is working post-childcare. Me: “The cat has vomited.” Him (horrified): “What?!” Me: “But it missed the carpet. It’s only on the tiles.” Him: “Well, that’s a win.” Clean up vomit, reflecting on new life in which vomit only on the tiles is a win. There’s a lesson in that, I’m sure. But I don’t know what it is. You live and learn. Well, at any rate, you live. - Douglas Adams Week three begins with the Primary Schooler bouncing into the bedroom while I’m still asleep. “I’ve lost my knick!” she announces. “Your what?” I ask, rearing upright.“My knick. My knick of Irish dancing.” Later, I finally realise: there is a knack to worksheets. They are not intended as a proof of my child’s perfection, and therefore my own educational and maternal brilliance. They are a chance for her to learn. Am totally ashamed to say this comes as a revelation. And bizarrely, makes me far less worried about doing them. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  1200: Primary Schooler spends afternoon with her father and I doing basic carpentry, making bridal couple from paper cups, painting fairy mushroom house, and going on long bike ride to a park where she makes a model boat for the pond. In the late afternoon, we go for an ice-cream. En route, we play I Spy. Me: “Something beginning with NP” (number plate). Her: “Nice pair.” At dinner, she is utterly delighted – though mystified – to have made her father and me laugh. She sings, performs her patented wind-up clock dance, makes jokes, recites whole sections of Bluey by heart. She is happy, I realise, to have spent the day with us.

Mr Meij told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald  that countries and companies around the world will adopt a ""sovereign mindset"" following the virus, which has disrupted supply chains globally. Domino's CEO Don Meij says the company is focused on ""doing good, not doing well"".Credit:Chris Hyde ""The disruption has made us think about our supply chains,"" he said. ""Australians are going to want more Australian-based products, Germans are going to want more German-based product."" The boss of the $4 billion pizza seller added that he had shied away from signing up to available government stimulus, with the business keen to limit its reliance on the public purse. ""We're privileged enough to trade, so why would we be [taking stimulus]? Anything we take on just delays the future of the country and has to be paid back at some point."" Mr Meij's comments come as Domino's on Friday warned investors of significant fluctuations in trade across its 825 Australian and New Zealand stores, sending shares down 3.5 per cent and dashing hopes it would become one of the big winners of the coronavirus shutdown. Domino's had been picked by market watchers as a potential beneficiary of the widespread coronavirus restaurant shutdowns and the government's stay-at-home orders, with predictions that home-delivered pizza orders would boom. While sales have stayed consistent over recent weeks, Mr Meij said, stores close to universities, in holiday locations or in city CBDs had experienced a fall in trade. Due to these fluctuations, Domino’s has had to pay out a higher level of franchisee support payments than it would in a usual period ""where sales growth is more evenly distributed across the business"". While Mr Meij did not specify the number of payments issued, he highlighted they were ""not as many as you think"". Support payments typically involve a waiver of Domino's franchise royalties and advertising costs. Some underperforming stores had sought rental relief from landlords and may apply for the government's JobKeeper subsidies, though Mr Meij stressed most stores had not needed any support. ""Our mission is to rely as little as possible on any government purse string,"" he said. The company's shares fell 3.5 per cent to $47.90 on Friday as the wider ASX 200 advanced, widening its 11 per cent loss in market value since the beginning of the year. However, Domino's is still outperforming the broader ASX 200, which is down 21.8 per cent over the same period. Citi analyst Craig Woolford labelled the result as ""mixed"", and noted while performance at the company's German and Japanese stores was strong, a slowdown of store openings remained a ""key risk"". Domino's still expects to grow store numbers by 7 per cent to 9 per cent over the medium term, though it has put recent store openings on hold. ""Domino’s has opened 34 stores so far in [second half]. A 'typical half' should be 100,"" Mr Woolford said. ""We are surprised Domino's stuck with store opening medium-term targets."" Mr Meij defended the maintained guidance and said the company would not need to rush to open stores in the 2021 financial year to meet its targets.

61,/business/markets/asx-falls-for-first-week-in-five-despite-friday-flurry-20200424-p54mtr.html,ASX falls for first week in five despite Friday flurry,"That's it for the blog this week. We'll return on Monday to do it all again. In the meantime, have a great, safe and relaxing weekend.  Scutty. Australian shares drifted higher on Friday, bucking weakness across the Asian region to snap a four day losing streak. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 rose 25.5 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5242.6, trimming its decline over the week to 4.5 per cent. Having rallied in the previous four weeks, the pullback likely reflects increased uncertainty on the outlook for corporate earnings, especially with economic data deteriorating fast. “The near-term focus remains on what the earnings profile will look like, and with many companies removing guidance due to the uncertainty, it makes navigating the equity market more difficult,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. “Finding the quality companies that will still be standing in a post-COVID world continues to be important.” For the moment, Mr Craig said unprecedented fiscal and monetary support continue to underpin equity valuations. “Markets are seemingly shrugging off the worsening economic data for the month of April,” he said. “When numbers become this extreme the market may be becoming a little desensitised, preferring to focus on whether this represents the trough and the support from central banks and governments.” Friday’s resilient performance was driven once again by the energy sector which gained 2 per cent, benefiting from a continued rally in crude oil futures during the Asian session. Oil Search rose 4.4 per cent to $2.61 whole Origin Energy added 2.5 per cent to $4.84. Materials and healthcare also rose 1.2 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively, ensuring the broader market closed in positive territory. For the miners, Fortescue Metals led the gains, rising 3.4 per cent to $11.45. In the healthcare space, CSL jumped 2.3 per cent to $313.75, reversing weakness seen on Thursday. Ramsay Healthcare followed a similar path, rising 2.4 per cent to $61.94. Having fallen sharply earlier in the week, travel stocks were also in demand. Webjet climbed 9.7 per cent to $2.50, Corporate Travel Management 6.8 per cent to $9.08 while Flight Centre added 4.2 per cent to close at $9.12. Qantas shares rose 1.5 per cent to $3.39. Not all big names enjoyed such stellar gains to end the week, however. James Hardie shed 2.3 per cent to $17.81, Sonic Healthcare 2.1 per cent to $24.48 while Macquarie Group fell 2 per cent to $95.01. This week media and mining magnate Kerry Stokes proved there is a different set of rules for billionaires. In spite of WA Premier Mark McGowan's declaration there would be zero exemptions on the state's tough COVID-19 quarantine restrictions on international arrivals, it was revealed Stokes and his wife were allowed to serve out their self-isolation at home in their Perth mansion, owing to Stokes' health issues, after they left the coronavirus hotbed of the Beaver Creek ski resort in the United States. But it turns out Stokes's Seven West TV and newspaper empire isn't blessed by the same immunity that protects its chairman. The company, which employs 4000 people, is among the 275,000 Australian businesses to register for the federal government's JobKeeper wage subsidy. To qualify Seven West would have had to demonstrate a more than 50 per cent decline in revenue since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. The company, which labours under a half billion dollar debt, is in deep trouble - just nine months after new CEO James Warburton boldly declared its new era as a ""corporate predator"". Stokes' decision to appoint Warburton to the top job at Seven West in August last year shocked the media industry. The supremely confident former ad-man left Seven in 2011 for rival Ten in deeply acrimonious circumstances. His return suggested Stokes had finally shaken off sentimentality after years of standing by Warburton's predecessor Tim Worner through a decline in the network's performance and a salacious sex scandal that was ultimately dropped. Yet now Seven West, in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic which has cruelled the entire media industry, is in deep trouble. The full feature from Liz is found here.  SWM shares are down 3.5 per cent at $0.083 in late trade. This might be the stupidest question you ever receive, but what do people mean when they talk about “the economy”? Last week my whole team had a Zoom meeting with our head of department and he said something like, “You all need to go to less days a week. That’s just the reality of the economy at the moment.” I’ve heard other pundits talk in the last months about “wrecking the economy” and “saving the economy”. This has got me to thinking I don’t really know what it means. Online definitions only confuse me more. Am I just dumb? I have to disagree that your question is unintelligent and the expert whose help I’ve sought on this subject agrees. Saul Eslake is an independent economist and Vice-Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Tasmania. “I don’t think it’s a stupid question at all. I suspect it crosses more than a few people’s minds from time to time,” he told me. “There are, of course, any number of dictionary definitions which do not, in my opinion, fully capture what economists understand by it.” You can find out Saul's definition by reading on here.  Flight Centre is attempting to soothe customer anger over its $300 cancellation charge by capping fees and offering incentives for people to take travel credits rather than refunds. The travel giant was facing a potential class action lawsuit after customers complained about the $300 per person fee for cancelling flights booked before the coronavirus outbreak, as well as a 12-week delay for refund payouts. Some customers have had their refunds reduced to zero as a result of the cancellation fees, while others with large groups have been asked to pay thousands of dollars in fees or take a travel credit instead. In a letter to customers on Friday morning, Flight Centre said cancellation fees would be capped at $600 for international bookings for two or more customers. Domestic travel cancellation fees will be capped at $100 per booking rather than $50 per person. The company also extended the expiry date for using travel credits from July 2021 to December 2021, after the initial 12-month deadline was widely criticised. You can read more here.  Flight Centre is among the top performers on the benchmark index today, jumping 4.3 per cent to $9.13. Other beaten-up travel stocks are also faring well with Webjet up 8.3 per cent to $2.47 while Corporate Travel Management has climbed 7.2 per cent to $9.115. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans says the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) won’t lift its cash rate until at least the end of 2023, reflecting the likelihood that unemployment will remain elevated over this period. “The unemployment rate is unlikely to fall much below 6 per cent and even if some short-term downward momentum builds in the unemployment rate the RBA will be cautious seeing no need to be pre-emptive,” Mr Evans said. “High spare capacity in the labour market will weigh on wages growth, household incomes and inflation. “These issues have been characteristics of the economy before the Covid crisis and are very likely to re-emerge in the post Covid era.” British-based EG Group's $25m play for Oliver’s Real Foods hangs in the balance after the coronavirus lockdown sparked a blowout in the fast food outlet's debts, making it the second corporate takeover to be struck by the pandemic in Australia. Privately owned European fuel and convenience retailer EG last month failed to gain the upper hand in a multibillion-dollar battle with Canadian giant Alimentation Couche-Tard for control of petrol giant Caltex Australia. However, EG’s defeat was short-lived, with Couche-Tard withdrawing its $8.8 billion offer for Caltex on Monday because of the extreme uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after it lobbed its unsuccessful bid for Caltex, EG turned its attention to making a minnow play for Oliver’s, a health-conscious fast food network which has 25 stores in service stations around the country. EG, or Euro Garages, made a non-binding, conditional offer of 10¢ per share for Oliver’s that, at the time, valued the company at $25 million on a share price of 0.065¢. The deal, under a scheme implementation deed agreed by the two companies on March 11, was conditional on Oliver’s and its subsidiaries not exceeding net indebtedness of $800,000. But the deadly coronavirus pandemic has now caught up with EG’s aspirations. Simon has more here.  It’s not quite getting the same attention as usual due to speculation over the outlook for the economy, but the US earnings season is now well and truly underway. American Express, American Airlines and Verizon will be the headline acts later this evening. Less traffic means less accidents, and that means downside risks to any business that deals in the automotive repair trade, AMA Group included. Given that backdrop, the market has savaged the company’s shares this year, leaving them down 58.1 per cent. UBS expects there’ll be brighter times ahead for AMA despite slow business at present. “AMA may actually benefit in a post COVID-19 environment, where holiday makers take domestic driving trips over international holidays,” UBS said. Trading on an estimate FY22 PE multiple of 6.8 times, which on balance UBS believes “looks attractive”, it decided to leave a buy rating on the stock, albeit with a sharply lower price target of $0.55. AMA Group shares are up 1.3 per cent to $0.38 today. After a string of four losses, it looks like the local market may finish the week on a positive note. The S&P/ASX 200 is currently up 0.5 per cent at 5244.8. It had been up as much as 0.9 per cent earlier in the session. All sectors aside from industrials, utilities, financials and consumer discretionary are trading higher, continuing to be led by energy and materials. Of note, crude oil futures are still on a tear, jumping over 5 per cent in Asia. The performance of the local market stands in stark contrast to that of the region and US and European futures markets which are all lower. All major indices in Asia are down by 0.1 per cent to 1 per cent, the NZX 50 in New Zealand the one exception with a gain of 0.2 per cent. US S&P 500 futures are also sinking, falling 0.5 per cent. STOXX 50 futures are down significantly more at 2.4 per cent. Copyright © 2020", David Scutt ,"April 24, 2020"

In a letter to customers on Friday morning, Flight Centre said cancellation fees would be capped at $600 for international bookings for two or more customers. Domestic travel cancellation fees will be capped at $100 per booking rather than $50 per person. The company also extended the expiry date for using travel credits from July 2021 to December 2021, after the initial 12-month deadline was widely criticised.

Other beaten-up travel stocks are also faring well with Webjet up 8.3 per cent to $2.47 while Corporate Travel Management has climbed 7.2 per cent to $9.115. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans says the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) won’t lift its cash rate until at least the end of 2023, reflecting the likelihood that unemployment will remain elevated over this period. “The unemployment rate is unlikely to fall much below 6 per cent and even if some short-term downward momentum builds in the unemployment rate the RBA will be cautious seeing no need to be pre-emptive,” Mr Evans said. “High spare capacity in the labour market will weigh on wages growth, household incomes and inflation. “These issues have been characteristics of the economy before the Covid crisis and are very likely to re-emerge in the post Covid era.” British-based EG Group's $25m play for Oliver’s Real Foods hangs in the balance after the coronavirus lockdown sparked a blowout in the fast food outlet's debts, making it the second corporate takeover to be struck by the pandemic in Australia. Privately owned European fuel and convenience retailer EG last month failed to gain the upper hand in a multibillion-dollar battle with Canadian giant Alimentation Couche-Tard for control of petrol giant Caltex Australia. However, EG’s defeat was short-lived, with Couche-Tard withdrawing its $8.8 billion offer for Caltex on Monday because of the extreme uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after it lobbed its unsuccessful bid for Caltex, EG turned its attention to making a minnow play for Oliver’s, a health-conscious fast food network which has 25 stores in service stations around the country. EG, or Euro Garages, made a non-binding, conditional offer of 10¢ per share for Oliver’s that, at the time, valued the company at $25 million on a share price of 0.065¢. The deal, under a scheme implementation deed agreed by the two companies on March 11, was conditional on Oliver’s and its subsidiaries not exceeding net indebtedness of $800,000. But the deadly coronavirus pandemic has now caught up with EG’s aspirations. Simon has more here.  It’s not quite getting the same attention as usual due to speculation over the outlook for the economy, but the US earnings season is now well and truly underway. American Express, American Airlines and Verizon will be the headline acts later this evening. Less traffic means less accidents, and that means downside risks to any business that deals in the automotive repair trade, AMA Group included. Given that backdrop, the market has savaged the company’s shares this year, leaving them down 58.1 per cent. UBS expects there’ll be brighter times ahead for AMA despite slow business at present. “AMA may actually benefit in a post COVID-19 environment, where holiday makers take domestic driving trips over international holidays,” UBS said. Trading on an estimate FY22 PE multiple of 6.8 times, which on balance UBS believes “looks attractive”, it decided to leave a buy rating on the stock, albeit with a sharply lower price target of $0.55. AMA Group shares are up 1.3 per cent to $0.38 today. After a string of four losses, it looks like the local market may finish the week on a positive note. The S&P/ASX 200 is currently up 0.5 per cent at 5244.8. It had been up as much as 0.9 per cent earlier in the session. All sectors aside from industrials, utilities, financials and consumer discretionary are trading higher, continuing to be led by energy and materials. Of note, crude oil futures are still on a tear, jumping over 5 per cent in Asia. The performance of the local market stands in stark contrast to that of the region and US and European futures markets which are all lower. All major indices in Asia are down by 0.1 per cent to 1 per cent, the NZX 50 in New Zealand the one exception with a gain of 0.2 per cent. US S&P 500 futures are also sinking, falling 0.5 per cent. STOXX 50 futures are down significantly more at 2.4 per cent. Copyright © 2020", David Scutt ,"April 24, 2020"

Some analysts foresee a litigious phase as victims' families rally in anger in Facebook groups and prosecutors weigh manslaughter charges over deaths at some nursing homes. The country's coronavirus epidemic was among the world's deadliest, with an official toll of more than 25,000. And the grievances are emerging as the government wrestles with lifting the lockdown, what it calls phase two.

""The pandemic is going to turn into a big collective trial."" Prosecutors have begun investigating whether errors by authorities had contributed to or caused the deadliest clusters. Liberal members of Parliament have accused the conservative government in the Lombardy region, where the country's first infections appeared, of exacerbating the contagion. About 45,000 relatives of coronavirus victims have joined ""NOI Denunceremo"" (""We will denounce you""), a Facebook group for people who believe that not enough was done to save their relatives. Lawyers have begun advertising their services to mourning families in response to allegations of mistakes committed by healthcare workers in treating coronavirus patients.

She added that, at this point, she would not know whom to sue. Diego Federici, 35, said that his mother had the coronavirus and died on March 25 after doctors in a hospital in Treviglio, near Milan, decided not to intubate her. His father, who was never admitted to an intensive care unit, had died four days earlier. Federici said he had joined the NOI Denunceremo Facebook group, adding that he could not accept that two healthy people had died within four days. ""Nobody is going to give me my parents back,"" he said, ""but if someone did something wrong, they should pay for it."" Luca Fusco, the founder of the Facebook group, initially posted his email address for members to send their stories anonymously, but dozens of members soon started directly publishing their testimonies every day. The authors do not directly accuse healthcare workers of malfeasance. As the painful stories of the epidemic piled up on Facebook, judiciary authorities began searching for someone to blame. Prosecutors started an investigation into what they call an ""involuntary epidemic"" at a hospital in Alzano, near Bergamo, where the virus spread through the medical wards. Maria Cristina Rota, Bergamo's prosecutor, told the news agency Ansa that a pool of prosecutors would ""take care of all the investigations about the epidemic in the Bergamo area."" They are also considering manslaughter charges against directors of retirement homes where hundreds of residents died and where the full death toll may have been hidden. Italians are not the only ones seeking some form of accountability for the pandemic. In the United States, the state of Missouri filed a lawsuit against the Chinese government on Wednesday (AEST), saying its response to the outbreak that emerged in the city of Wuhan had led to devastating economic losses in the state. A ski resort hotel in the Dolomites also presented a subpoena in an Italian court seeking compensation from China's Health Ministry for loss of business after the outbreak, Marco Vignola, the lawyer for the hotel, told news outlets. ""The early and sudden closure led to disastrous consequences, including the dismissal of all staff and the cancellation of contracts with suppliers,"" the lawyer was quoted as saying.

The findings, based on 166 sets of data covering 1676 sites in 41 countries dating as far back as 1925, provided a nuanced assessment for insects, the most ubiquitous and diverse animals on the planet. An insect flies next to a flower in Erfurt, Germany.Credit:AP Insects such as mosquitoes - which live in the water as larvae - as well as midges, mayflies, water beetles and caddisflies that spend at least part of their lives in freshwater were found to have experienced a population increase of about 11 per cent per decade. Freshwater covers only about 2.5 per cent of the Earth's surface, so the vast majority of insects live on land. Other bugs are disappearing at a rate of just under 1 per cent a year, with lots of variation from place to place, according to the study published in the journal Science. That's a tinier population decline than found by some smaller localised studies, which had triggered fears of a so-called insect apocalypse. But it still adds up to something ""awfully alarming"", said entomologist Roel van Klink of the German Centre for Integrative Biology, the study's lead author. An invasive brown marmorated stink bug. Credit:DPI ""The decline across insect orders on land is jaw dropping,"" said Michigan State University butterfly expert Nick Haddad, who wasn't part of the study. ""Ongoing decline on land at this rate will be catastrophic for ecological systems and for humans. Insects are pollinators, natural enemies of pests, decomposers and besides that, are critical to functioning of all Earth's ecosystems."" The number of insects on average has declined in the air, in the grass and on the soil surface, but not in trees or underground, the researchers found. Projecting the trends into the future shows that land-dwelling insects would sustain a population drop of 24 per cent over 30 years while the freshwater bugs would experience a 38 per cent increase over the same period. ""Insects are a central part of almost all ecosystems because they stand in the middle between the plants they eat and the animals that eat insects, like birds, bats and lizards,"" van Klink said. ""They also impact our own lives, often in ways we don't think about. Insects pollinate many of our crops, and without them we would have no fruits and no flowers. But at the same time, insects transmit terrible diseases like malaria, Zika and West Nile virus, they eat our crops and damage tree plantations,"" van Klink added. The study did not break down the findings by species. There was scant data from South Asia and the Middle East, and limited data from Africa.  The strongest declines were documented in the mid-western United States and in Germany. The researchers credited clean-water policies instituted in recent decades for the increase in freshwater bugs. They attributed the declines in land-dwelling insects to human activities such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, urbanisation, light pollution and chemical pollution, while saying insecticides and increased droughts due to climate change may also have played a role.

The event was the Anzac Day dawn service in Martin Place. The year was 1972, when Australia still had a handful of troops in Vietnam. But I was oblivious to all that. I was just a kid hanging out with his father. Sir David Martin with the author, his son Will. The morning was clear but cool and my mother had sent me off in one of those big coats that had wooden toggles instead of buttons. Most people seemed to be smoking. Very old men with jangly medals were helped from cars. I proudly held Dad’s hand. He was my hero, a dashing navy officer who had been captain of a very impressive warship. He was in uniform, wearing his medals. I watched fascinated by the strange ritual of people saluting one another. The service meandered along; people read poems and sang songs. Then everything went eerily quiet ... until another man in uniform started playing what I assumed was a trumpet. Something changed. Dad’s grip on my hand tightened, just enough for me to look up and see tears slipping down his cheeks. The foundations of my young life shifted. My invincible, fearless warship captain father had been brought to tears by two notes on what I now know was a bugle. I was confused. It took me several years to join the dots. I think I knew in 1972 that Dad’s father had been killed in a sea battle but I hadn’t realised that Dad himself had been a little boy of eight when his mother had received an awful telegram: “With deep regret I have to inform you your husband, Commander William Harold Martin RAN, is missing as a result of enemy action. Minister for the Navy and the Naval Board desire to express to you their sincere sympathy.” It was March 1942 and Dad’s father was MIA, people said, “missing in action”. My dad wrote optimistic letters to his missing father for the rest of the war. He wrote near the end of the war: “Dear Daddy, I hope you are quite well. We have been keeping the house and garden in order – both jobs are tedious!” He signed off: “I’m itching to see you after these three and a half years. I’ve been looking after mummy for you. Love David.” Soon after the war ended, his mother received further correspondence from the authorities: “Exhaustive investigations have been conducted and with deep regret I must inform you that no hope can now be held that your husband has survived the war.” William Harold Martin, the father of the former governor of NSW, Sir David Martin. The boy, my dad, had lost his father, a zealous young second-in-command of HMAS Perth, one of Australia’s most famous fighting ships, in the Battle of Sunda Strait, off Indonesia. The Japanese invasion force had sunk the Perth. William “Pincher” Martin, like 357 of his 680 shipmates, had “no grave but the cruel sea, no flowers lay at his head, a rusting hulk is his tombstone, afast on the ocean bed”. Perhaps it was these words, from the Naval Ode, that were on Dad’s mind as he wept quietly with me at dawn in 1972. When I first held the hand of my young son at an Anzac Day service, I was in uniform, having returned from service as captain of HMAS Darwin. I reflected on three generations of Australian navy men, of service and of sacrifice. And I prayed silently that my boy would never have to face an enemy in action, as his great grandfather had in 1942. My family story shapes what Anzac Day means to me. I believe it’s a day for people to pause, reflect and grieve. There are 364 other days every year when we can celebrate being Australian. But on Anzac Day, on Saturday, we should think about the many families still dealing with the consequences of war, and of the women and men affected by their work in peacekeeping, humanitarian and border protection operations. COVID-19 has stopped Anzac Day services. But it should not stop us pausing to honour the day. My father, Sir David Martin, became a rear admiral and died in 1990, three days after standing down as the 34th Governor of NSW. He had developed mesothelioma, the disease associated with breathing filaments of asbestos, which he would have encountered on HMAS Sydney in 1951-2, during the war in Korea. In the days prior to his death he established the Sir David Martin Foundation, Helping Young People in Crisis. Thirty years on, service and sacrifice remain his legacy.

73,/national/schools-should-be-allowed-to-reopen-soon-but-with-a-caveat-20200423-p54mo1.html,Schools should be allowed to reopen soon - but with a caveat,"The proof of Australia's success so far in the coronavirus crisis is that children will soon be going back to school. The ferocious political debate about the return to the classroom is now mostly about how to make the change – and not so much about whether that change should come. The greatest cost is to the children, especially those who do not have speedy Wi-Fi and patient parents.Credit:Tanya Macheda But there is one fundamental fact that is too easily lost in the highly emotional arguments among politicians, parents, teachers, unions and everyone else with an opinion about when students must be back at their desks. ""This is like a spot fire during a bushfire – until everything is out, anything can happen,"" says James McCaw, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne. In other words, any plan should be dropped in an instant if the coronavirus ignites again in some part of the community. This will be deeply frustrating to parents who want to plan for the term ahead, or teachers who are preparing their lessons, but there is no point demanding certainty when this virus allows none. McCaw is a professor of mathematical biology who works with colleagues at the Doherty Institute on the modelling that helps guide national cabinet in its response to this crisis. He believes there is a better case for resuming school classes than some of the other options over the weeks ahead. Replay   Every option involves risk. What should be allowed: large weddings, football games, house parties or eat-in restaurants? It is impossible to reopen everything because that would put Australia on the path to copying Italy, so it is about choosing one option over another. There is a powerful case for making schools the priority. The disruption to school education has been severe and parents are not the only ones paying the price. ""Early on parents were pushing for schools to be closed,"" says a federal government backbencher. ""Now a lot of parents have home-schooling fatigue."" The greatest cost is to the children, and especially those who do not have large homes with speedy Wi-Fi and patient parents. The greatest damage from an extended period of online learning is to those who need the classroom more than most. So there is a compelling case for a staged return to school in the timeframe set out by NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, with classes from May 11. First, a study in The Lancet, a medical journal, concluded this month that school closures alone would prevent only 2 to 4 per cent of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Second, the COVID-19 figures in Australia show the small scale of the threat to children. Of the 1337 cases in Victoria, only 58 involve patients under the age of 20. All of them have recovered except for one male teenager. Of the 2971 cases in NSW as of Wednesday night, only 121 were under the age of 20. Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician, a professor at the Australian National University and a senior specialist at ACT Pathology at Canberra Hospital, is one of the experts who thinks schools should reopen with strict controls. ""I accept the evidence is incomplete, but all the evidence in Australia at the moment is that the risk of transmission is low,"" he says. While schools could be called ""petri dishes"" for influenza because children spread the disease, Collignon says the science on COVID-19 so far suggests it is very different. Put simply, children do not appear to be major spreaders. Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of New South Wales, backed the school closures in March and is cautious about reopening. She believes schools must stop contact between parents – there will be no time for talking at the morning drop-off – and safeguard teachers. ""The return must be done slowly, with good data, and a public health strategy to continue social distancing and be able to respond immediately to any parents, children, or school staff who report feeling unwell,"" she says. This means parents have to stay away from each other, teachers have to minimise contact with each other and those who are most vulnerable to the virus – older teachers, or those with health conditions – have to be able to stay home. While Berejiklian is in a fight with the main teachers' union about her plan, the nature of the argument is a sign of progress despite the intense rhetoric. NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos wanted kindergarten and Year 12 to resume first, rather than the premier's approach of resuming all classes for all children for one day a week, then two days a week, and so on. What is interesting is that Gavrielatos is not objecting to the May 11 deadline. The longer the country keeps the virus case numbers down, the harder it will be for Victorian premier Daniel Andrews to tell parents to keep their children at home. Will it be safe to return to school from the middle of May? ""It should be being considered right now as a reasonable and possible timeline,"" says McCaw. ""We will know in a couple of weeks if it is still reasonable to consider."" There is an essential but unpalatable proviso in McCaw's comment. Only when a school reopens could the medical experts really know if it is safe. The moment a COVID-19 breakout occurs, the approach has to change. There are no options without risk, but the priority should be to return children to their classrooms and end the inferior education of the computer screen.

74,/money/borrowing/three-cheaper-alternatives-than-taking-a-mortgage-holiday-20200423-p54mp2.html,Three cheaper alternatives than taking a mortgage holiday,"I’ve never seen banks more lenient. They’re bending over backwards to help customers during the coronavirus crisis. For businesses, they’re extending discounted loans, fee waivers and expedited processing. For residential mortgage holders, they’re giving up-to six-month repayment holidays. Taking a payment holiday on your home loan will cost you more in the long run.Credit:Louie Douvis However, just remember that for all of the above, for the banks it will mean short-term pain for longer-term gain. It's the opposite for borrowers, who mostly will pay more. According to RateCity, a half-year mortgage holiday towards the beginning of an average $400,000 loan at 3.54 per cent will end up costing you an extra $6000 – even if you lift your repayments afterwards, so that your loan term stays the same. That would require an extra $62 a month. And if you instead keep your payments at their original level, the loan will blow out by more than $17,000 – and 15 months! However, there are three smarter, cheaper ways than cutting your mortgage payments. Money asked loan comparison website Mozo to identify the most competitive deals with offset accounts (we disregarded home loans without real offset accounts, which are a really powerful debt-reduction tool, so looked at mortgages from authorised deposit-taking institutions only). Many borrowers are learning the hard way – as banks refuse to extend repayment holidays to people who have accelerated repayments directly into their mortgages – that paying extra into a companion, quarantined offset account is a smarter and safer move. In the global coronavirus crack-up, US financial institutions have even stopped borrowers accessing these savings, when it was assumed they could always be easily redrawn. The average variable rate for an owner occupier making principal and interest mortgage repayments is now 3.43 percent. But the best-value mortgages – the cheapest with real offset accounts – start at 2.55 per cent (HSBC, MOVE Bank, G&C Mutual Bank and Easy Street round out the top four). A move from the average advertised Big 4 package rate, at 4.51 per cent, would save $421 a month. However, you might not even have to move banks. Our largest institutions are disclosing a discount of some 0.7 per cent, and will be giving far more on the sly. Even the disclosed discount would save almost $200 a month without having to move… and you could angle for more, based on the fact you know you could be paying as little as 2.55 per cent. Interest-only mortgages have long been on the nose with Australia’s financial regulators, as they sought to deflate an overheated – and over-leveraged – property market. As such, hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders have been switched to principal and interest in recent years, to ensure they chip away at their debt. Going interest-only can as much as half your repayment overnight. It also saves you from expensively paying interest on interest, as you would if you took a total mortgage holiday. You can return to paying principal, well, just as soon as you can. My three rules for fixing a home loan interest rate are: Only ever fix half of the loan, only for a maximum of three years and only if you can get an immediate discount on your payments… and today you can. While variable rates are down 24 basis points since the start of March, the typical one-year fix has been slashed 52 points. Mozo says there are fixes of 2.09 per cent available over one, two and three years (lenders include Well Home Loans, Reduce Home Loans and ING). Just be aware that when you fix, you often can’t pay extra off the home loan, to save interest and slash your loan term. Fixed rates usually come with a substandard offset account, too.

75,/national/covid-19-is-on-the-ropes-but-it-could-still-fight-back-20200423-p54moy.html,COVID-19 is on the ropes but it could still fight back,"Australia is now more than three weeks into the stage three lockdowns introduced to fight COVID-19 and the truly encouraging news is that the disease is losing. When the lockdown was declared Australia was recording more than 300 new cases a day. On Thursday the national figure was just seven.  We are the envy of countries around the world but our success creates new dangers. The most obvious of these is succumbing to the growing pressure to scrap social distancing restrictions and fully restart the economy. It is natural that people want to return to normal, meet their friends and relatives and send their children back to school. Hundreds of thousands of businesses are on the brink of financial ruin and want to get back to work. In the US protesters have even taken to the streets demanding a premature end to the lockdowns. The result is some US states are rushing relaxing restrictions even though their morgues struggle to bury the dead. Australia has got this far by sticking to a careful plan, however, and now is not the time to throw it out the window. The restrictions must be rolled back gradually and in a way that ensures the coronavirus remains under control. Prime Minister Scott Morrison foreshadowed on Thursday that he may ease restrictions soon and that Australia could even reopen borders with New Zealand, which has made similar progress flattening the infection curve. But he also insisted it must be a “COVID-safe economy” and the process could take months. That delay will be frustrating to many because they imagine that the crisis has passed. This is understandable. Even the government says modelling shows the rate of undetected disease in the community is very low. But to understand the danger of dropping our guard, look to Singapore which was once the poster child for how best to manage a national COVID-19 response. Over the past week Singaporean authorities discovered a neglected cluster of infections and suddenly cases have shot up to thousands a day. The city state is back in lockdown – jolted back to square one while the death rate rises fast. To avoid that fate the timetable for reducing restrictions should be based on a careful assessment of a multitude of factors rather than simply the rate of new infections or deaths. Unfortunately, even with cases close to zero, there is always the possibility a few cases have gone undetected in the community. As Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy told a Senate committee on Thursday, ""we have to be very aware that while we have only had seven cases in the last 24 hours, there is a permanent risk of further cases. This is a highly infectious virus and it can take off fairly quickly”. Australia cannot relax until we are sure we have the capacity to test all suspected cases as an early warning and to ruthlessly track any cases that do occur. We must ensure our health services are prepared for any accidental outbreaks. And we should also embrace the government’s TraceTogether app, which can identify people who have come into contact with someone diagnosed with the virus. With those conditions in place, governments should start The Great Reopening, carefully selecting activities and businesses that deliver maximum economic and social benefit for minimum risk of spreading the disease. It might take months to reopen high risk activities such as sports stadiums or night clubs and even longer to reopen our borders to tourists. If we keep our cool, however, Australia can emerge in a few months with the disease under control, thousands of lives saved and businesses ready to start rebuilding. If we fold too soon, the hard work could be lost.

Inside the race for a COVID-19 game-changer,"In a sprawling laboratory in Melbourne, an army of robots is joining the fight against COVID-19. The mission? To scan hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds, faster than humanly possible, searching for the “needle in the haystack” – the one that can be turned into a lifesaving drug against a dangerous and fast-moving new virus. Meanwhile, further down the corridors of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI), scientists are preparing to test not just how an existing drug might slow the new infection – but whether it can stop it taking hold altogether. And, next door at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, a huge trial is kicking off that will mean most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia and New Zealand can already opt in to an experimental treatment. A robot scans chemical compounds at the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute. This is just one stretch of the global frontline against COVID-19. The quest for a vaccine offering immunity from the new coronavirus has already been labelled this century’s space race, such is its speed. But moving just as fast is the hunt for a drug to treat it. Nobel-prize winning immunologist Professor Peter Doherty is hopeful the world will get its jab of immunity soon. But even the most optimistic predictions put a vaccine roll out into 2021. While we wait, treatments, ranging from existing drugs repurposed from the medicine cabinet to those that can stop the new virus infecting people in the first place, offer another road out of danger, he says. So what are the main therapy strategies and the most promising trials? And what about Donald Trump's drug of choice: hydroxychloroquine? Professor Marc Pellegrini says the National Drug Discovery Centre at WEHI is now focusing its huge drug screening capability on finding a cure for COVID-19.Credit:Cameron Wells/WEHI This virus has never been seen before in humans. There's still a lot we don't know about it and the illness it causes COVID-19, and most of our cells know even less. We don't have any natural immunity to fight it off and there's no known medical treatment or cure. ""None yet, anyway,"" says virologist and director at the Doherty Institute Professor Sharon Lewin. But there are two main ways to defeat a virus, she explains. You can stop it in its tracks directly with a drug that disrupts how the microbe hacks into our cellular machinery. Or you can help bodies cope with the invasion, ramping up or, more commonly in the case of a new unfamiliar pathogen, dampening down the immune system’s response as required. This stops the virus either overwhelming our body’s defences or sparking an overreaction, the kind that can spiral into what’s known as a ""cytokine storm"" as too many virus-fighting antibodies are called to the fight and our organs become collateral damage. This storm is already playing out in hospital wards across the world as patients' lungs and even hearts and kidneys start to fail under COVID-19. Some drugs could work on both the virus and our immune response, Lewin says. That includes the much-hyped anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Infectious disease clinician Professor Marc Pellegrini admits that, while the drug is already used safely to treat auto-immune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, researchers still aren't completely clear how it works. ""We think it can modulate the immune system so it might stop that initial blunderbuss immune defence we know can often do more harm than good, particularly in the case of a new virus,"" Pellegrini says. ""But in the lab it's also been shown to stop the virus replicating in cells."" Still, like those overzealous antibodies, against COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine could do more harm than good. Its among the therapies being considered because the fastest route to treating a new virus is to find an existing drug that can do the job, one already widely used with its own well-understood applications (and side-effects). The World Health Organisation launched an international ""mega trial"" known as SOLIDARITY on March 18, testing the four drugs it ruled had the most promise: an antiviral called Remdesivir that failed on Ebola but has shown some of the most encouraging early results against COVID-19; the anti-HIV drug combo Lopinavir/Ritonavir known as Kaletra; Inteferon, which is used to regulate the immune system and treat multiple sclerosis; and a late addition, following hype from the media and the US President, hydroxychloroquine. The trials are not double-blinded, the preferred gold standard, meaning patients taking part will know if they get an experimental treatment or if they're in ""the control group"" with just the current supportive care options. But scientists say the need for a fast roll-out and the large size of the new trials trump the risk of a placebo effect. They expect they will have meaningful results within months, even weeks. There's another less talked about possibility. In the race for either a vaccine or a treatment, scientists may find a therapy that can do both by stopping the virus taking hold in the first place. As Pellegrini explains: ""If you find a drug that stops the virus replicating and you give it to someone early enough, you can actually stop them getting infected."" Doherty agrees such drugs, which he likens to the preventative tablets taken to stop HIV infections, could be a gamechanger, offering a protective shield for at-risk groups such as the elderly or healthcare workers while the world waits for a vaccine. ""The earliest I've heard [for a vaccine] is still looking like 2021, we can't lock down that long,"" he says. ""Treatments, but also something that prevents the infection, like the HIV PreP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] drugs you take twice a day, could get us out of this earlier."" Trials are now underway all around the world to find such a dual-action chemical. In some, healthcare workers are given a course of hydroxychloroquine over many weeks or months, at a lower dose than in trials testing the drug on infected patients. Scientists are making no promises – a chemical that can kill the virus in a test tube will not necessarily stop it replicating in a human throat, says Pellegrini, who is leading one such prevention trial in Melbourne for WEHI, which will be double-blinded. But, if they succeed, will we all take one tablet a day to keep coronavirus at bay? Not according to researchers. Such a prevention drug would likely only be given to those deemed high risk or already exposed, the way the antiviral Tamiflu is sometimes given to people in close contact with an influenza case. ""All drugs have side-effects, especially if given to a big population,"" Pellegrini says. ""So, especially now the virus is not spreading as widely here in the community, if we find something that works and that's safe, you'd still want to target it to mini-outbreaks or people at risk, say, in aged care homes or healthcare workers."" ""Multi-pronged attack"": Scientists screening less common drugs for COVID-19 potential at WEHI say they might not get there first but it's important to have a back-up plan if one drug fails.Credit:WEHI Then there's work underway into whether immunity could be temporarily ""borrowed"" from recovered patients via antibodies in their blood. Successfully fighting off a virus leaves us armed with these tiny warrior proteins in case it comes back, usually conferring at least a period of immunity (if not always a lifelong shield). The idea is you could perform a kind of transfusion from survivor to patient, spinning out the blood plasma with the antibodies inside. There are lingering questions about just how many antibodies our bodies produce against COVID-19 and how long they last. But hospitals in the US are already running trials of blood plasma donations from survivors for critically ill patients. Of course, if it works, there will be another hurdle to pass – supply. The current survivors, however generous, cannot donate enough blood plasma to inoculate the world. ""We could make antibodies specific for the virus, we do [that] all the time,"" Doherty adds. ""We grow them in enormous quantities in vats."" Creating our own custom antibodies against COVID-19 comes with its own lengthy testing – and takes us back into the realm of vaccine development. At the very least, survivors of the virus now carry in their veins crucial molecular clues for both inoculation and drug therapy. To find out which drugs will work best against a new pathogen, scientists have to first play detective. Professor Mark von Itzstein, who heads the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University, says designing a drug to kill off the virus directly means finding a good target for the attack – usually the protein that the virus uses to break into human cells and start making copies of itself. In this case, the much talked about spike protein. A number of drugs have since emerged that show promise against the virus and its spiky weapon – killing it off at least in test tubes. ""We've been screening a lot of those, and already getting some hits,"" von Itztein says. ""We've got some low-hanging fruit I'm desperate to evaluate immediately. If we can show drugs are not toxic at the doses needed to kill this virus [or] get prevention drugs up too to protect our first responders from infection, we could save lives.” A huge clinical trial led by the Doherty Institute has now been assembled across 70 hospitals in Australia and 11 in New Zealand, meaning most COVID-19 patients in the region will be able to opt in for an experimental treatment. Dubbed the ASCOT trial, it will test two drugs, at least to start with: hydroxychloroquine and the HIV therapy Kaletra. Both have been shown to stop the virus replicating in the lab and have been approved for ""compassionate use"" by doctors with nothing else in their toolkit in some parts of the world including the US. But these human trials have so far been fairly small-scale, yielding mixed results. At least 75 per cent of the trial participants will be given one of the drugs. Of those, a third will get a combination of the two, which researchers hope might improve the odds. Even before doctors began trying it out in COVID-19 wards – and US President Donald Trump told Americans to go out and take it – the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine had drawn interest early into the pandemic because it had been shown to kill the virus in test tubes, infectious disease clinician Steven Tong says. It comes with a good safety record against autoimmune diseases and is cheap and easily taken in tablet form. How it might stop a COVID-19 infection in animals or people is another story. Often what looks good under a microscope will fail or even make things worse in a human. The drug's side-effects can include heart problems, which is of particular concern, some experts say, because COVID-19 is known to attack the heart. One small trial of the drug on COVID-19 patients in France claimed to have a 100 per cent success rate but this was later disproved when serious problems with the research design emerged, including the fact one patient had died. Still, that didn't stop the hype. A larger study which has not yet been put through rigorous peer review has since suggested the drug does not reduce the risk of a COVID-19 patient deteriorating at all, and even hinted it might have exacerbated organ damage when given to a number of veterans hospitalised with the illness in the US. But, once again, experts have raised concerns about the study's design, including Professor Pellegrini who says the drug may have only been given to the sickest patients already in decline and so results should be interpreted with caution. Right now, hydroxychloroquine is available only with a prescription and should not be taken except under medical advice. A different form of the compound, which is not safe for humans, is sold as fish-tank cleaner. After Trump told people to try hydroxychloroquine (""What have you got to lose?"" he said), one man in Arizona took the fish cleaner, and died. Associate Professor Steven Tong is leading the trial from the Royal Melbourne Hospital and says the team will be keeping a close eye on other trials and lab studies around the world. Drugs showing promise can be added into the mix, pending supply. Nothing has been shown to work yet, all researchers stress – it's not time to rush out to a pharmacy or doctor. ASCOT had hoped to include another frontrunner, the intravenous drug Remdesivir, but was knocked back by the company that makes it, Gilead, due to supply issues. Gilead is rationing the drug for trials in countries with more patients, the Australian team says, but if more becomes available, it too might be tested here over the next 12-18 months. (Though a draft report from the WHO trial reportedly suggests it may not be the wonderdrug the world is hoping for). The ASCOT trial is designed to adapt as more information comes to hand - a drug performing well can be given to more patients while something reacting poorly or even causing harm can be dropped entirely. This antiviral didn't have much luck when it was deployed on the ground last year against an Ebola outbreak in the Congo and it's not yet widely used. But because it works by blocking a crucial protein that many viruses use to copy themselves, it's considered a broad antiviral – in the lab it also killed SARS and MERS, the other two dangerous coronaviruses to emerge in humans in the modern era. Against the virus that causes COVID-19, it also worked in both mice and cells in a dish. Some experts have theorised it will work best in the early stages of an infection but, because it has to be given to patients intravenously, it is unlikely to be deployed in mild cases. It is now being tested against COVID-19 overseas, including in China and the US, and is already widely approved for compassionate use by doctors - causing shortages of the drug that led its manufactuer to deny trials in both Australia and the UK access for testing. But on April 24, The Guardian reported the WHO had accidentally released a draft report into the first full trial of the drug early - and the document, which had not yet been peer-reviewed, showed it failed to help patients.  Back to the robots. As with many labs around the world, WEHI is now drawing on huge chemical databases to see if a drug that can fight COVID-19 might already on its books, even from the scrap heap of previous medical trials. ""Maybe there's a drug designed for a skin rash that didn't work on that but passed human trials,"" Pellegrini says. ""It might just kill COVID-19 or keep a cell alive against it."" To find this coveted compound, researchers are turning to artificial intelligence, machines that can run around the clock on a miniaturised scale not possible for humans, mixing different chemicals with viruses and cells, and using computer algorithms to decide which reactions look promising. The institute's new National Drug Discovery Centre is home to the largest screening effort in Australia. Pellegrini likens it to a factory assembling cars. “We can’t promise we’ll find a miracle drug, more likely it will help against the next pandemic,” he says. While the drug candidates already in trials had been quickly picked out from a screening of ""the usual suspects"", he stresses much is still not understood about the way COVID-19 operates. “So we need to cast our net wide too, and search as much as we can. We're throwing everything at it.” Another drug that has hit headlines after showing some virus-destroying power in test tubes is Ivermectin, commonly used to treat head lice and other parasites. It too already comes with a strong safety record as a prescribed medicine. But infectious disease clinician Steven Tong points out that the dose required to kill the new virus may be far too high to safely give to humans. The ASCOT trial is waiting on some extra lab studies before making a decision on whether to test it in patients. Fresh studies suggest the dose required to stop the virus may be up to 50 times the amount safe for humans.  Further north in Queensland, Professor von Itzstein is taking a different approach to fast-track screening. ""We're doing a broad look too, it may turn out to be really important,"" he says. ""But I want to solve this disease now.' In most labs around the world, drugs are screened against viruses using monkey cells, usually from the kidneys, he says. ""That's fine so long as we assume they're just like human respiratory cells. We didn't want to assume. We're using human respiratory cells straight away as well as some lung cells too [taken from] volunteers and then grown in the lab."" In the dish, he says the cells have little hairs. They beat and breathe. ""They're beautiful, living beasts. This is what the virus sees. So when we're testing on them we can already say it's more likely to get a similar result in a human. Of course in people it might be different again but we think we can get there [without] having to go into animal models. We are far, far closer."" Von Itzstein's team at Griffith University is testing how drugs can protect live human respiratory cells (above) from the virus. Once he and his team zero in on some likely contenders, von Itzstein has more in mind than just human trials. He wants to figure out how he could make the existing drugs being tested in hospitals even better at fighting COVID-19. His team use 3D modelling to map viruses and design ""plugs"" or molecules that can slot between the microbe and our cells to stop it replicating. If it can't get into cells to duplicate, it can't survive. ""Of course, we'll have to go through clinical trials again just in case the tweaks we've made create anything [harmful] but we'll already know a lot about the [existing] drug, how it works...we'll have a headstart."" Doherty says the work shows real promise. ""We might need something specifically designed for COVID-19."" Scientists have become first responders in the battle against the pandemic, putting in long hours in labs, including at The Walter Eliza Hall Institute's drug discovery lab.
Credit:WEHI Unlike the last pandemic, swine flu in 2009, this time the world is almost starting from scratch. Back then, a vaccine against the new influenza strain also had to be hastily pulled together but the virus was at least a somewhat familiar foe. The foundations for an inoculation were already laid from seasonal flu and there were two strong antiviral drugs that worked against it. One of them was Relenza, the world's first designer influenza drug, created by von Itzstein. “In 2009, the big difference was we had drugs that worked already in hospitals,” he says. ""We didn't see the diaster we see now."" No vaccine exists for a coronavirus, not even against the other two dangerous strains to emerge in the modern era, SARS and MERS. And, as both have struggled to attract research funding as caseloads fell, there are no proven drug therapies either. But scientists had been warning for years that another SARS-like coronavirus would emerge in humans thanks to ""spillovers"" from the animal world which are happening more and more as people encroach on habitats and poach wildlife. Doherty says that before COVID-19 burst onto the scene in December, the world had been taking some early steps towards preparing for its next pandemic, launching a rapid response vaccine program, CEPI, in 2017 for just such an event, with coronaviruses earmarked as priority. But in hindsight, he says there should have been a similar accelerator set up for reactive drug therapies too. ""It was something we've been missing that I mumbled about but I didn't shout about,"" Doherty says. ""We've done alright with the vaccines but we should have kept testing drugs [for] SARS, right across the coronaviruses, even others like Hendra virus. There's a lot of lessons here.""

Inside the race for a COVID-19 game-changer,"In a sprawling laboratory in Melbourne, an army of robots is joining the fight against COVID-19. The mission? To scan hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds, faster than humanly possible, searching for the “needle in the haystack” – the one that can be turned into a lifesaving drug against a dangerous and fast-moving new virus. Meanwhile, further down the corridors of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI), scientists are preparing to test not just how an existing drug might slow the new infection – but whether it can stop it taking hold altogether. And, next door at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, a huge trial is kicking off that will mean most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia and New Zealand can already opt in to an experimental treatment. A robot scans chemical compounds at the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute. This is just one stretch of the global frontline against COVID-19. The quest for a vaccine offering immunity from the new coronavirus has already been labelled this century’s space race, such is its speed. But moving just as fast is the hunt for a drug to treat it. Nobel-prize winning immunologist Professor Peter Doherty is hopeful the world will get its jab of immunity soon. But even the most optimistic predictions put a vaccine roll out into 2021. While we wait, treatments, ranging from existing drugs repurposed from the medicine cabinet to those that can stop the new virus infecting people in the first place, offer another road out of danger, he says. So what are the main therapy strategies and the most promising trials? And what about Donald Trump's drug of choice: hydroxychloroquine? Professor Marc Pellegrini says the National Drug Discovery Centre at WEHI is now focusing its huge drug screening capability on finding a cure for COVID-19.Credit:Cameron Wells/WEHI This virus has never been seen before in humans. There's still a lot we don't know about it and the illness it causes COVID-19, and most of our cells know even less. We don't have any natural immunity to fight it off and there's no known medical treatment or cure. ""None yet, anyway,"" says virologist and director at the Doherty Institute Professor Sharon Lewin. But there are two main ways to defeat a virus, she explains. You can stop it in its tracks directly with a drug that disrupts how the microbe hacks into our cellular machinery. Or you can help bodies cope with the invasion, ramping up or, more commonly in the case of a new unfamiliar pathogen, dampening down the immune system’s response as required. This stops the virus either overwhelming our body’s defences or sparking an overreaction, the kind that can spiral into what’s known as a ""cytokine storm"" as too many virus-fighting antibodies are called to the fight and our organs become collateral damage. This storm is already playing out in hospital wards across the world as patients' lungs and even hearts and kidneys start to fail under COVID-19. Some drugs could work on both the virus and our immune response, Lewin says. That includes the much-hyped anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Infectious disease clinician Professor Marc Pellegrini admits that, while the drug is already used safely to treat auto-immune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, researchers still aren't completely clear how it works. ""We think it can modulate the immune system so it might stop that initial blunderbuss immune defence we know can often do more harm than good, particularly in the case of a new virus,"" Pellegrini says. ""But in the lab it's also been shown to stop the virus replicating in cells."" Still, like those overzealous antibodies, against COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine could do more harm than good. Its among the therapies being considered because the fastest route to treating a new virus is to find an existing drug that can do the job, one already widely used with its own well-understood applications (and side-effects). The World Health Organisation launched an international ""mega trial"" known as SOLIDARITY on March 18, testing the four drugs it ruled had the most promise: an antiviral called Remdesivir that failed on Ebola but has shown some of the most encouraging early results against COVID-19; the anti-HIV drug combo Lopinavir/Ritonavir known as Kaletra; Inteferon, which is used to regulate the immune system and treat multiple sclerosis; and a late addition, following hype from the media and the US President, hydroxychloroquine. The trials are not double-blinded, the preferred gold standard, meaning patients taking part will know if they get an experimental treatment or if they're in ""the control group"" with just the current supportive care options. But scientists say the need for a fast roll-out and the large size of the new trials trump the risk of a placebo effect. They expect they will have meaningful results within months, even weeks. There's another less talked about possibility. In the race for either a vaccine or a treatment, scientists may find a therapy that can do both by stopping the virus taking hold in the first place. As Pellegrini explains: ""If you find a drug that stops the virus replicating and you give it to someone early enough, you can actually stop them getting infected."" Doherty agrees such drugs, which he likens to the preventative tablets taken to stop HIV infections, could be a gamechanger, offering a protective shield for at-risk groups such as the elderly or healthcare workers while the world waits for a vaccine. ""The earliest I've heard [for a vaccine] is still looking like 2021, we can't lock down that long,"" he says. ""Treatments, but also something that prevents the infection, like the HIV PreP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] drugs you take twice a day, could get us out of this earlier."" Trials are now underway all around the world to find such a dual-action chemical. In some, healthcare workers are given a course of hydroxychloroquine over many weeks or months, at a lower dose than in trials testing the drug on infected patients. Scientists are making no promises – a chemical that can kill the virus in a test tube will not necessarily stop it replicating in a human throat, says Pellegrini, who is leading one such prevention trial in Melbourne for WEHI, which will be double-blinded. But, if they succeed, will we all take one tablet a day to keep coronavirus at bay? Not according to researchers. Such a prevention drug would likely only be given to those deemed high risk or already exposed, the way the antiviral Tamiflu is sometimes given to people in close contact with an influenza case. ""All drugs have side-effects, especially if given to a big population,"" Pellegrini says. ""So, especially now the virus is not spreading as widely here in the community, if we find something that works and that's safe, you'd still want to target it to mini-outbreaks or people at risk, say, in aged care homes or healthcare workers."" ""Multi-pronged attack"": Scientists screening less common drugs for COVID-19 potential at WEHI say they might not get there first but it's important to have a back-up plan if one drug fails.Credit:WEHI Then there's work underway into whether immunity could be temporarily ""borrowed"" from recovered patients via antibodies in their blood. Successfully fighting off a virus leaves us armed with these tiny warrior proteins in case it comes back, usually conferring at least a period of immunity (if not always a lifelong shield). The idea is you could perform a kind of transfusion from survivor to patient, spinning out the blood plasma with the antibodies inside. There are lingering questions about just how many antibodies our bodies produce against COVID-19 and how long they last. But hospitals in the US are already running trials of blood plasma donations from survivors for critically ill patients. Of course, if it works, there will be another hurdle to pass – supply. The current survivors, however generous, cannot donate enough blood plasma to inoculate the world. ""We could make antibodies specific for the virus, we do [that] all the time,"" Doherty adds. ""We grow them in enormous quantities in vats."" Creating our own custom antibodies against COVID-19 comes with its own lengthy testing – and takes us back into the realm of vaccine development. At the very least, survivors of the virus now carry in their veins crucial molecular clues for both inoculation and drug therapy. To find out which drugs will work best against a new pathogen, scientists have to first play detective. Professor Mark von Itzstein, who heads the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University, says designing a drug to kill off the virus directly means finding a good target for the attack – usually the protein that the virus uses to break into human cells and start making copies of itself. In this case, the much talked about spike protein. A number of drugs have since emerged that show promise against the virus and its spiky weapon – killing it off at least in test tubes. ""We've been screening a lot of those, and already getting some hits,"" von Itztein says. ""We've got some low-hanging fruit I'm desperate to evaluate immediately. If we can show drugs are not toxic at the doses needed to kill this virus [or] get prevention drugs up too to protect our first responders from infection, we could save lives.” A huge clinical trial led by the Doherty Institute has now been assembled across 70 hospitals in Australia and 11 in New Zealand, meaning most COVID-19 patients in the region will be able to opt in for an experimental treatment. Dubbed the ASCOT trial, it will test two drugs, at least to start with: hydroxychloroquine and the HIV therapy Kaletra. Both have been shown to stop the virus replicating in the lab and have been approved for ""compassionate use"" by doctors with nothing else in their toolkit in some parts of the world including the US. But these human trials have so far been fairly small-scale, yielding mixed results. At least 75 per cent of the trial participants will be given one of the drugs. Of those, a third will get a combination of the two, which researchers hope might improve the odds. Even before doctors began trying it out in COVID-19 wards – and US President Donald Trump told Americans to go out and take it – the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine had drawn interest early into the pandemic because it had been shown to kill the virus in test tubes, infectious disease clinician Steven Tong says. It comes with a good safety record against autoimmune diseases and is cheap and easily taken in tablet form. How it might stop a COVID-19 infection in animals or people is another story. Often what looks good under a microscope will fail or even make things worse in a human. The drug's side-effects can include heart problems, which is of particular concern, some experts say, because COVID-19 is known to attack the heart. One small trial of the drug on COVID-19 patients in France claimed to have a 100 per cent success rate but this was later disproved when serious problems with the research design emerged, including the fact one patient had died. Still, that didn't stop the hype. A larger study which has not yet been put through rigorous peer review has since suggested the drug does not reduce the risk of a COVID-19 patient deteriorating at all, and even hinted it might have exacerbated organ damage when given to a number of veterans hospitalised with the illness in the US.

78,/politics/federal/how-will-the-coronavirus-app-work-20200421-p54ltg.html,How will the coronavirus app work?,"The federal government wants you to download an app. The app – a tool you will be able to download to your smartphone soon – would speed up contact tracing for new coronavirus cases. Contact tracing is one of the ways some governments, including ours, are suppressing the spread of this virus. When someone falls ill, a special team quickly gathers as much information as they can from the patient, then calls up anyone who's had close contact with them while they were infectious and tells those people to isolate themselves. The government says contact tracing is a must-have in order for them to even consider relaxing lockdown laws. Hundreds of contact tracers are working in teams across Australia already. The app, says the government, will offer an additional automated version of this process. By enabling your phone to identify who's near you and preparing a record of who you've been near that's ready to go in case you ever contract COVID-19. It would save time. It might even save lives. But in a new world of big data, experts have serious concerns about even seemingly tiny bits of information being shared with the government. The app may well mark the start of a fresh tension between civil liberties and lifesaving not seen since policies made after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. So how would the coronavirus app work? Could the personal data it takes be stolen or misused? Will the app actually save lives? All smartphones have Bluetooth. We use it to connect our phones to other devices such as speakers, smartwatches and printers. Bluetooth can also be used to communicate wirelessly with other phones – and that's how the app will identify who you've been near. The phones will communicate with each other as you do in a call-and-response game, let's say, Marco, Polo. If you have downloaded the free app (by selecting it in the app store on your phone), your phone will send little signals every now and then – the ""marco"" – and if there's a phone nearby where someone has downloaded the app, it will register a ""polo"" in response. If you later contract COVID-19, all the ""polos"", or responses, your phone registered that belonged to phones that were within 1.5 metres of you (which is the required proximity for social distancing) for at least 15 minutes will be sent off to a central government database. The app is based on a similar piece of software out of Singapore, called TraceTogether. Australia joins Germany and Denmark in looking to push out a contact tracing app within the next couple of weeks. This is where it gets a little trickier - and where some experts have concerns over privacy. The government has said it's taking only a very limited amount of personal data from app users: your name, mobile number, postcode and an age range. And the government has stressed what it's not taking: it won't actually ever keep track of where you are, just who you're with. To add an extra layer of security, they've made it so that when a phone picks up another user near it, it isn't able to know any of that information. How? By giving everyone an anonymous ID – so when your phone says ""marco"", it doesn't actually know who is ""poloing"" back. But for the app to work, the government needs to have a way to turn that anonymous ID into a full name and number – they need to contact trace somehow. Somewhere out there, there has to be a secret key that will unlock a secret database that turns an anonymous ID into someone's contact details. That's where privacy concerns come in. Replay   The most likely way your personal data could be misused or stolen is through that secret database. Richard Buckland, a professor in cyber security at UNSW, says that's where the real danger lies. ""If you know the secret keys – the passwords that the government uses to set this up – you can work out what all the anonymous IDs would be. That's one little secret you need to get a hold of a database where you can access every 'polo' they're going to call out,"" he says. The federal government has given some assurances - they won't have access to this database, Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed on April 21, and only state health officials tasked with contact tracing will be able to see what's inside. But there's still a lot we don't know. Earlier, the government said they would release the source code of the app - the backroom details showing how it is designed – but has now said it will keep parts of the code secret. And we don't know how long the app will be used – perhaps right up until a vaccine is distributed. So how likely is it that the secret database could be hacked? It's almost inevitable, Professor Buckland says. ""I would assume the database would be compromised,"" he says. ""Everything can be hacked. The [United States'] National Security Agency and Facebook are both far better funded than we are – and they've both been breached."" Australian National University Cyber Institute chief executive Lesley Seebeck says similarly: ""If someone is determined to get in they will get in – if a nation state wants to get in they will."" The government has limited the amount of data that can be hacked. Data will only be sent to the secret database if someone tests positive for coronavirus, and they consent to that data being shared. That means that if someone successfully accessed the database, they wouldn't get a full list of everyone you have interacted with since downloading the app – but they would know what your anonymous ID is. And the limited data could be hacked. ""Secret services in other countries could set up their own Bluetooth beacons,"" Professor Buckland explains, ""they could put a Bluetooth beacon outside all Canberra brothels, for instance – and all of a sudden you've got the ability to identify someone's phone because they're constantly emitting that beeping Bluetooth 'marco' out of it."" And while the app doesn't strictly collect location data, Professor Buckland says it wouldn't be hard to figure that out from the Bluetooth pings. There are algorithms around that can figure out whether you're on a crowded train, or a shopping centre, or your home, based on the frequency of signals emitted. The data could be used to blackmail people having affairs, or threaten journalists working on sensitive stories, or go after high-level executives thinking of working for another company. Professor Buckland makes another point about your personal data: we don't know for sure how a government of the future will use this new information. He fears governments will take this app as permission to encroach on civil liberties in the months and years ahead - in what is known in academic circles as scope creep. ""With anti-terror legislation after [September 11], we started with one or two acts ... now there's more than 50,"" he says. It's impossible to say at this stage. The app will help contact tracing only if the people you have been in contact with also have it downloaded on their phones – and we don't know how many people will download it. The argument from Prime Minister Scott Morrison is that if enough people take up the app – he wants 40 per cent of Australians using it – then that will not only hasten the coronavirus contact tracing process but give an additional safeguard needed to reopen parts of the country. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth described the app not as essential to health outcomes but as the ""icing on the cake"" for an already ""well-oiled"" tracing regime. There is no data publicly available that shows how effective this will be, though. While some tech business leaders have been positive about the app, others have reservations. UNSW epidemiologist professor Mary-Louise McLaws, who sits on a World Health Organisation panel that advises on the preparedness, readiness and response to coronavirus, says, during the process of contact tracing, memory can fail patients distressed with a virus diagnosis. ""People who are probably very upset, potentially sick and anxious, have to now try to recall everyone who they had any contact with – that can be difficult when it's trying circumstances,"" Professor McLaws says. The epidemiologist says there could be more use in shortening the timeframe for contact recording to five or 10 minutes, rather than 15. Professor Seebeck from the ANU Cyber Institute fears it may even slow down contact tracing teams. ""What proportion of cases that we already know of fit within the 1.5 metre, 15-minute window? We're already told we shouldn't shake hands – we don't shake hands for 15 minutes,"" she says. ""And [coronavirus] lingers on surfaces – that's not going to be captured by the app."" The Cyber Institute chief executive says the app could generate a lot of false positives, putting extra work on contact tracing teams who now have to chase up more people. There's no way of knowing if the app saves lives – or, using Prime Minister Morrison's language, saves livelihoods – until we see it in action. Will Professor Buckland download the app? ""If the situation got really bad,"" he says, ""and this made a big difference, I wouldn't think twice."" ""But I would want to make sure there was assurance this was a temporary thing, that there wasn't scope creep, and that I could opt out at any time."" Will Professor Seebeck? No. ""Not until I have trust in the government. And they've got to work on it. It's up to the more powerful partner in the relationship to give trust, it's not for them to demand it."" What about the epidemiologist, though? ""I wouldn't recommend anyone download the app,"" Professor McLaws says. ""We need to have wider community consultation - and have it done rapidly - about how long the data is held for and who holds it, and then is it removed completely and not used for secondary purposes.""

79,/politics/federal/how-will-the-coronavirus-app-work-20200421-p54ltg.html,How will the coronavirus app work?,"The federal government wants you to download an app. The app – a tool you will be able to download to your smartphone soon – would speed up contact tracing for new coronavirus cases. Contact tracing is one of the ways some governments, including ours, are suppressing the spread of this virus. When someone falls ill, a special team quickly gathers as much information as they can from the patient, then calls up anyone who's had close contact with them while they were infectious and tells those people to isolate themselves. The government says contact tracing is a must-have in order for them to even consider relaxing lockdown laws. Hundreds of contact tracers are working in teams across Australia already. The app, says the government, will offer an additional automated version of this process. By enabling your phone to identify who's near you and preparing a record of who you've been near that's ready to go in case you ever contract COVID-19. It would save time. It might even save lives. But in a new world of big data, experts have serious concerns about even seemingly tiny bits of information being shared with the government. The app may well mark the start of a fresh tension between civil liberties and lifesaving not seen since policies made after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. So how would the coronavirus app work? Could the personal data it takes be stolen or misused? Will the app actually save lives? All smartphones have Bluetooth. We use it to connect our phones to other devices such as speakers, smartwatches and printers. Bluetooth can also be used to communicate wirelessly with other phones – and that's how the app will identify who you've been near. The phones will communicate with each other as you do in a call-and-response game, let's say, Marco, Polo. If you have downloaded the free app (by selecting it in the app store on your phone), your phone will send little signals every now and then – the ""marco"" – and if there's a phone nearby where someone has downloaded the app, it will register a ""polo"" in response. If you later contract COVID-19, all the ""polos"", or responses, your phone registered that belonged to phones that were within 1.5 metres of you (which is the required proximity for social distancing) for at least 15 minutes will be sent off to a central government database. The app is based on a similar piece of software out of Singapore, called TraceTogether. Australia joins Germany and Denmark in looking to push out a contact tracing app within the next couple of weeks. This is where it gets a little trickier - and where some experts have concerns over privacy. The government has said it's taking only a very limited amount of personal data from app users: your name, mobile number, postcode and an age range. And the government has stressed what it's not taking: it won't actually ever keep track of where you are, just who you're with. To add an extra layer of security, they've made it so that when a phone picks up another user near it, it isn't able to know any of that information. How? By giving everyone an anonymous ID – so when your phone says ""marco"", it doesn't actually know who is ""poloing"" back. But for the app to work, the government needs to have a way to turn that anonymous ID into a full name and number – they need to contact trace somehow. Somewhere out there, there has to be a secret key that will unlock a secret database that turns an anonymous ID into someone's contact details. That's where privacy concerns come in. Replay   The most likely way your personal data could be misused or stolen is through that secret database. Richard Buckland, a professor in cyber security at UNSW, says that's where the real danger lies. ""If you know the secret keys – the passwords that the government uses to set this up – you can work out what all the anonymous IDs would be. That's one little secret you need to get a hold of a database where you can access every 'polo' they're going to call out,"" he says. The federal government has given some assurances - they won't have access to this database, Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed on April 21, and only state health officials tasked with contact tracing will be able to see what's inside. But there's still a lot we don't know. Earlier, the government said they would release the source code of the app - the backroom details showing how it is designed – but has now said it will keep parts of the code secret. And we don't know how long the app will be used – perhaps right up until a vaccine is distributed. So how likely is it that the secret database could be hacked? It's almost inevitable, Professor Buckland says. ""I would assume the database would be compromised,"" he says. ""Everything can be hacked. The [United States'] National Security Agency and Facebook are both far better funded than we are – and they've both been breached."" Australian National University Cyber Institute chief executive Lesley Seebeck says similarly: ""If someone is determined to get in they will get in – if a nation state wants to get in they will."" The government has limited the amount of data that can be hacked. Data will only be sent to the secret database if someone tests positive for coronavirus, and they consent to that data being shared. That means that if someone successfully accessed the database, they wouldn't get a full list of everyone you have interacted with since downloading the app – but they would know what your anonymous ID is. And the limited data could be hacked. ""Secret services in other countries could set up their own Bluetooth beacons,"" Professor Buckland explains, ""they could put a Bluetooth beacon outside all Canberra brothels, for instance – and all of a sudden you've got the ability to identify someone's phone because they're constantly emitting that beeping Bluetooth 'marco' out of it."" And while the app doesn't strictly collect location data, Professor Buckland says it wouldn't be hard to figure that out from the Bluetooth pings. There are algorithms around that can figure out whether you're on a crowded train, or a shopping centre, or your home, based on the frequency of signals emitted. The data could be used to blackmail people having affairs, or threaten journalists working on sensitive stories, or go after high-level executives thinking of working for another company.

Of course, it was heavenly, an experience I shall cherish for the rest of my life. It is also a treat I shall likely pay for the rest of my life, a chuck-it-all-on-the-credit-card-and-work-it-out-later break without logic and financial sense. Since returning, I have never been more broke – but there is a happy point to this story – I have never been more content to be so. You see, I am having some wonderful insights into money and, in understanding how to live somewhat frugally, I am enjoying the little things in life a whole lot more than I used to. 'A small part of me also knows that I will no longer waste money like I used to. I won’t believe the marketing hype of the new and novel. I won’t pine for what I don’t have but enjoy what I do.'Credit:iStock Today, I know that an expensive meal in a fancy restaurant is nice, but not if it equals my weekly grocery bill. So now I feed those same friends I’d dine out with, appreciating the adage that food is love by serving it at home with lots of pride and little expense. Even though I love a bargain, I can walk past all the shiny things in sale season that would normally incite desire, with the knowledge it is just stuff and I already have more than I’ll ever want or need. In doing so, I have rediscovered clothes I’ve never worn and enjoyed making them work. I go to the library and borrow books rather than shelling out for them new. I eschew the empty dreams of over-promising cosmetics and beauty products and stick to what will do the job cheaply and efficiently – no bells, whistles or fancy packaging that only ends up in landfill. I don’t need a new car; mine runs perfectly well. I don’t crave designer furniture but take pleasure in restoring an op-shop find, sanding and polishing it back to its original beauty. Instead of forking out money on presents for friends, I find their favourite photo, have it printed and place it in a reclaimed frame – something received with much more applause than a bottle of bubbly or a bouquet of flowers that will only shrivel and die. But the greatest discovery is one I never thought I’d be able to bear: accepting the generosity of others. I am – or was – the person who would always pay a bill rather than suffer the awkwardness of others counting up the cost of their meal, down to how many pieces of bread they ate or glasses of wine they imbibed. This division of money made me uncomfortable, so I took the pain away at that moment, only to pay for it later. Also, I enjoyed shouting, believing it a way to show my gratitude for fine friends and food. So when I was on that recent holiday, and friends with more money than I have insisted on paying, I swallowed my pride and accepted. It was not easy to do; in fact, I had to call my brother, a man who has always been generous to a fault, and talk it through with him. “I get where you are coming from but here’s the thing you are forgetting and I have to remember, too – other people enjoy giving just as much as you do,” he wisely advised. “If they want to pay, allow them to do it. I know you have picked up more than your share of tabs in the past. What goes around, comes around. At the moment, it’s other people’s turn. Yours will come again.” So I am allowing myself to step back and enjoy the liberality of those who wish to share it, in the knowledge that it makes them happy to do so – just as it did me. And I know that once I am back on my feet again, I’ll take pleasure in picking up the tab once more. But a small part of me also knows that I will no longer waste money like I used to. I won’t believe the marketing hype of the new and novel. I won’t pine for what I don’t have, but enjoy what I do. Because as I age, I am more aware than ever that possessions don’t make me happy, but experiences do. And if being careful about how I spend at home allows me to enjoy travelling and indulging abroad, I’m all for it.

Corona De Vries, an eight-year-old from the Gold Coast, wrote to the Hollywood star after he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had spent more than two weeks in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19 there. Replay   The boy had written to Hanks saying: ""I heard on the news you and your wife had caught the coronavirus"". ""Are you OK?"" He said he loved his name but people at school called him the coronavirus, which made him ""sad and angry"". ""Your letter made my wife and I feel so wonderful!"" Hanks replied in a letter typed on a Corona typewriter which he had taken to the Gold Coast. ""You know, you are the only person I've ever known to have the name Corona - like the ring around the sun, a crown,"" the double Oscar winner wrote to the boy. ""I thought this typewriter would suit you. ""Ask a grown up how it works. And use it to write me back."" Hanks handwrote at the end: ""P.S. You got a friend in ME!"" Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson were quarantined in Australia after contracting coronavirus.

90,/culture/books/school-activist-daisy-jeffrey-s-first-book-is-aimed-at-adults-not-teens-20200420-p54lfu.html,"School activist Daisy Jeffrey's first book is aimed at adults, not teens","Non-fiction reviewer Fiona Capp and fiction reviewer Cameron Woodhead each have four new titles for you to explore, including their picks of the week. Strike organiser Daisy Jeffrey has something to say on hope.Credit:Louise Kennerley   On HopeDaisy JeffreyHachette, $16.99  Credit:  When Daisy Jeffrey, one of the organisers of the School Strike 4 Climate, was asked to write this essay, it was to be ‘‘On Change’’, which she regarded as ‘‘a hell of a lot easier than ‘On Hope’ ’’. Not surprisingly, given the patronising opposition that the movement is up against, this essay – bursting with the energy and longing of adolescence – swings between hope and despair as Jeffrey struggles to keep up with her school work while taking to the world stage to give voice to young peoples’ fears for the future. In documenting how she became an activist, she demonstrates that the only lasting antidote to the feelings of helplessness that breed despair is working for change. She doesn’t want adults to put their hope in young people, she wants everyone to take responsibility and take action. PICK OF THE WEEKEllis Rowan: A Life in PicturesChristine Morton-EvansNLA Publishing, $34.99  Credit:  If Indiana Jones has an Australian forerunner, it’s got to be Ellis Rowan. The sight of this ‘‘petite, elfin-featured woman, armed with painting gear and parasol, negotiating murky swamps and snake-infested jungles in full Victorian attire’’, says Christine Morton-Evans, ‘‘amazed all who came across her’’. Controversial and undaunted by convention, she pursued her botanical specimens in dangerous locations with the zeal of one seeking the holy grail. She won innumerable medals for her paintings and became a household name both for her work and her embellished reports of her intrepid adventures. Yet she is now largely forgotten. For all the drama and tragedy of her life, her sometimes delicate, sometimes luscious, paintings steal the show in this handsome publication that, a century after her death, restores her work to its rightful place in the public gaze. Valkyrie: The Women of the Viking WorldJohanna Katrin FridriksdottirBloomsbury, $40  Credit:  There’s little evidence that Viking women fought in battle as popular television drama would have it. Yet Norse sagas are full of powerful, ferocious heroines, from the valkyries – supernatural beings who decide who will die in battle – to vengeful, blood-thirsty queens who use their children as political pawns. While historically unreliable, the sagas highlight the ‘‘horrific costs’’ women paid in ‘‘an unyielding culture of honor’’, says Johanna Katrin Fridriksdottir. At the same time, however, Norse laws gave married and widowed women considerable rights and security. The author’s dilemma, in this scholarly study, is to reconcile the larger-than-life legends of monstrous mothers and terrifying shield maidens with the more mundane and complex reality of daily life for Viking women from childhood to old age. The School of RestorationAlice Achan & Philippa TyndaleAllen & Unwin, $32.99  Credit:  ‘‘Why am I still alive,’’ Alice Achan asked herself, ‘‘when almost every person I rose for each morning is gone?’’ Her happy childhood in a village in northern Uganda had been shattered by the Lord’s Resistance Army and she was paralysed by grief. After years of struggling to get an education and a diploma in social work, she still felt overwhelmed by the brutal experiences of girls who had been abducted by rebels. An urgent desire took hold of her to open a school for these survivors of sexual violence. ‘‘In the school of my dreams, girls would be nurtured by their teachers, and learn that they are equal to any other person.’’ Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this against-all-odds story of the academy she founded is Achan’s and her students’ conviction that only forgiveness ‘‘can release us from the bondage of bitterness’’.   PICK OF THE WEEKThe Night WatchmanLouise ErdrichCorsair, $32.99  Credit:  Louise Erdrich was inspired to write The Night Watchman by the experience of her grandfather – a Chippewa man who lived on the Turtle Mountain reservation in North Dakota and who fought, in the 1950s, to stop the US government from dispossessing his people of their land. Thomas Wazhushk is a night watchman galvanised into action that will take him to Washington D.C. to save his community. We also follow his niece Patrice, a factory-worker with an alcoholic father, and sole breadwinner for her family. Patrice leaves the reservation for the first time determined to find her sister Vera, last seen in Minnesota. Although Thomas’ political battle has momentous consequence, what stands out is more intimate: the telling detail, the warmth and compassion Erdrich brings to her portrayal of characters struggling to navigate two worlds. The Night of All SoulsPhilippa SwanVintage, $32.99  Credit:  In lockdown I recently reread Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence. Was there ever a writer so sharp, so acidic in her assessment of society, yet so generous in her imagination of the people trapped within it? In The Night of All Souls, she returns from the grave. Philippa Swan’s erudite homage takes a page from Wharton’s unheralded ghost stories: the author is resurrected in an anteroom to the afterlife, and given a novella about a woman who works at the Wharton museum in Massachusetts. Edith must decide whether to publish or burn the work, revisiting her own writing in the process. It may have the trappings of a ghost story, but the most appealing element of Swan’s novel is its submerged literary appreciation of Wharton’s oeuvre, delivered in tandem with lively elements of biography, and shades of the wit and style for which Wharton was renowned. Gathering EvidenceMartin MacInnesAtlantic, $29.99  Credit:  Abstract, unnerving quasi-detective fiction with traces of absurdist dystopia, Gathering Evidence draws a husband and wife into parallel investigations. It begins with a treatise on a new social media app called Nest, which collates user data and derives a unique pattern from it. Soon, no one can make serious life decisions without consulting their patterns. That menacing prospect hovers as we meet John, a programmer with a large tech company, and his wife Shel, a primatologist. Shel travels to Africa to investigate the death of bonobos in a national park. Plans change and a dangerous situation develops. Meanwhile, John is attacked by an unknown assailant, and wakes up to visits from an anonymous medico; he must piece together his memories to discover what is happening to him and why. MacInnes has created a strangely prescient vision that fuses risks of ecological catastrophe, technological dependence, and social isolation. Hitler’s PeacePhilip KerrHachette, $32.99  Credit:  The late Philip Kerr’s historical detective novels (set in Nazi Germany and featuring Bernie Gunther, a former policeman turned private investigator) were more than entertaining bestsellers. And if fans can’t look forward to further books in the series, there’s still Hitler’s Peace, which offers a twist-riddled and meticulously constructed espionage thriller wrapped in alternate history. It’s autumn, 1943 and Willard Mayer – philosophy professor, lothario and US spy – has been sent to Tehran by Roosevelt for the Allied conference with Churchill and Stalin. Knowing the war cannot be won, Hitler wants peace and only Churchill won’t negotiate. Enter Mayer, whose shadowy career may have involved being a double- and even triple-agent, and the stage is set for a spy novel with very high stakes. Kerr writes with great style and intelligence and departs from history with convincing plausibility. Copyright © 2020"," Fiona Capp , Cameron Woodhead ","April 24, 2020"

A day after describing the NRL’s May resumption plan as ‘‘premature’’, free-to-air broadcast partner Nine softened its stance and will now support the proposed date, avoiding a potential courtroom showdown.

The pair had made hundreds of phone calls to each other in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic threatened the future of Australian rugby. But this one was different. Castle, at this stage still the Rugby Australia chief executive, was taping a pre-recorded interview with the ABC's current affairs flagship, 7.30, that afternoon. Replay   She wanted to know if there was anything coming down the pipeline at her before she went on national television to present a united front for the riven code. As McLean explained in detail on Friday, ""all [Castle] ever wanted was to know that the board supported her and whilst that was the case she would run through broken glass to get things done"".  She asked that if, at any stage they believed the game was better off with someone else at the helm, that they be open and upfront about it. The answer from McLean on Thursday morning was 'no'. What the respected former Wallabies captain meant was 'nothing in the next 48 hours'. What is now clear, acknowledge by McLean and confirmed by another board source, was that the interim chairman and the seven other non-executive directors – Phil Waugh, Pip Marlow, Hayden Rorke, John Wilson, Daniel Herbert, Peter Wiggs and Brett Godfrey – had decided it was time to move on Castle during a conference call the night before. But Castle, satisfied with her chairman's reassurance the next morning, recorded the interview at Rugby Australia's Moore Park headquarters, wrapping up at about 4.15pm on Thursday, in the belief she had the board's backing. She spoke to presenter Leigh Sales about the damaging letter signed by 10 Wallabies captains, calling for sweeping change, that had dropped on Monday night and eclipsed RA's closing of a time-buying pay deal with the game's 192 professional players. Rugby Australia chairman Paul McLean. She deflected a question about the relentless criticism levelled at her over her gender, nationality and appearance, chalking it up to the rough and tumble of sports administration. And she spoke, somewhat elegiacally, about the impending arrival of new Wallabies coach Dave Rennie: ""He will come here regardless of where I sit but I would certainly like the opportunity to work with him because together I think we can deliver some really great outcomes."" Castle will not get that chance. She finished the interview and was confronted by a raft of media enquiries, to her directly and to RA's corporate affairs boss Michael Earsman, asking whether she was aware of the board's intention to sack her within the next week. She was not, the message came back to the Herald, and was not aware the non-executive directors had met on Wednesday night. Alarm bells rang at 5pm when Castle did not join an important conference call with the Super Rugby chairmen, Wiggs and chief financial officer Simon Rabbitt, that had been called to give the states their first look at RA's 2019 financials and cash position and forecasts. No one could explain her absence. She was on the phone to McLean again, asking him to explain whether the media knew something she didn't. This time, the chairman levelled with her. Wednesday night's call had resolved that it was time for fresh leadership, but had not finalised a time frame to make that happen and, crucially, did not have a plan for who would take her place. They were planning to talk to Castle early next week to let her know their thinking. Castle, hurt that the board had allowed her to record the ABC interview – it ended up going to air with a preamble including the chief executive's resignation statement – wanted to take control. She told McLean she was resigning. ""In the last couple of hours it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need,"" she said in a statement. ""The game is bigger than any one individual – so this evening I told the chair that I would resign from the role. I will do whatever is needed to ensure an orderly handover."" The source told the Herald that most of the directors wanted it noted that the Wallabies captains' letter had nothing to do with their decision to move on Castle. But, with the RUPA pay deal locked away, securing more than $12 million in savings on player wages over the next two quarters, and a World Rugby loan application all but granted, it was felt the organisation could start looking beyond September and to what a rebuild might look like. As McLean said on Friday morning: ""...in a normal circumstance without the things that happened in the last two years and some of the unwarranted criticisms and bullying, I think it might have been a different scenario. At the end of the day the board has to make a decision about how the game can progress and if there was a clearer pathway to doing that, we needed to take that pathway because we represent and manage the whole of the game."" The ""last two years"" was likely a reference to the Israel Folau saga, which broke three months into Castle's time at Moore Park and all but swallowed up the game for much of the next 18 months. Raelene Castle at the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne in December.Credit:AAP There was also a feeling that the virus outbreak and the ensuing shutdown presented the board with an opportunity to reshape the structure of the game in Australia, from competitions to governance. Castle's admirable determination to take all the bullets fired at the organisation over the past two years had left her irreparably damaged, they felt. It was time to find a replacement. It was only a pity they did not save Castle from one last humiliation, finding out from the media her days were numbered.

Cricket Australia says big hits will keep coming,"The nation was on the brink of COVID lockdown, Australia having just played New Zealand before a deserted SCG, when Cricket Australia realised it might go broke. On March 19, chief executive Kevin Roberts canvassed the possibility to stunned board members that the game could run out of money by the end of August. His language was measured but, to experienced corporate directors dialled into the Microsoft Teams conference call, the implications were clear. David Warner and Aaron Finch marched on to an empty SCG to take on New Zealand in early March.Credit:AAP Without an urgent financial overhaul, cricket’s national governing body risked trading while insolvent. At a glance, Cricket Australia’s balance sheet appeared healthy. With its broadcast partners having deposited the latest instalment of a six-year, $1.8 billion rights deal, it had nearly $100 million squirrelled away for the winter. Yet, as Roberts mapped the outgoings, the mounting pressure on its broadcast and corporate partners and the impact of the sharemarket crash on Cricket Australia’s investment fund, his projections showed that the dollars could disappear quicker than a legside full toss. “It was certainly plausible that our cash and investments could track down to zero at the end of August, absolutely,’’ Roberts says. “Which is why we’ve had to take the action that we have.’’ Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts.Credit:Getty Images Not everyone in cricket is convinced. Two of the game's most influential stakeholders, the professional players and state associations, are sceptical about the depth of the financial crisis and the explanations given so far by Cricket Australia. They have asked to see more detailed financial information before they agree to Cricket Australia’s proposal to cut player payments and grants to the states by a quarter. Roberts warns the game must prepare for a “new normal” after the pandemic with significantly reduced revenue. At a minimum, Cricket Australia is seeking to cut 25 per cent from its operating costs and for the states and players to accept a proportionate cut. It is also planning for things to get a lot worse. Replay   “What we have done is to make sure we have a plan for cricket to withstand a 50 per cent reduction in revenue if we need it to,’’ he tells The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. “It is not suggesting things will get to that point but it is ensuring we don’t retrospectively find that we haven’t planned appropriately for what we could be facing in the following financial year. “Part of this was dealing with issues that have occurred already and part of it is making sure that cricket can withstand the issues that may come at us next season.” This Rumsfeldian mix of known and unknowns has made for a muddled explanation as to how a game so flush with cash could get to this point. As the chief executive of one corporate partner put it, “the numbers don’t stack up”. Within Cricket Australia there is acknowledgment that even without the pandemic the organisation’s cashflow would have cut uncomfortably close to the bone this winter. A game which generated total revenue of $486 million in FY 2019 was predicted to get down to its last $40 million. This wild fluctuation in cash flow, although a product of the vagaries of the international touring schedule, the disparate drawing power of England and India compared with other nations and the seasonal nature of cricket revenue, prompted Cricket Australia before the COVID crisis to consider a capital working facility – a secure line of credit from a bank – to better manage its financial peaks and troughs. “It is evident that in addition to holding reserves we need an ongoing, working capital facility to buffer against the significant ups and downs,’’ Roberts says. When Roberts added in the potential impact of the pandemic, the board backed his decision to bring in an experienced corporate toe-cutter Paul Reining, to take charge of finances at Jolimont. The Cricket Australia crisis management team comprises Reining, who previously helped Roberts restructure the financially stricken sports apparel company 2XU, chief operating officer Scott Grant, CA chairman Earl Eddings and board members Paul Green and Michelle Tredenick. Eddings is the managing director of a risk management company, Green a KPMG partner and Tredenick a board member of the Insurance Australia Group and Bank of Queensland. Cricket Australia’s long-serving chief financial officer Todd Shand, having resigned in January, agreed to stay on to help weather the crisis. There are four parts to cricket’s plan for financial survival; to secure a working capital facility, to cut the organisation’s operating expenses, to reduce grants to the states and to reach agreement with the players’ union for an “amended player payment model.” The most dramatic step taken so far is Cricket Australia’s decision to stand down until June 30 about 80 per cent of its staff. Cricket Australia has registered for the federal government JobKeeper scheme but is uncertain whether it will apply. It will pay affected staff either 20 per cent of their wages or the JobKeeper amount of $1500 a fortnight, depending which is higher. Roberts and his executive team have accepted a 20 per cent pay cut and a waiving of all performance bonuses for this financial year. Roberts says the mass standing down will preserve about $3 million of expenses but the decision is less about saving money than spending it responsibly. COVID restrictions means that, for many Cricket Australia staff, there is simply not enough work to do. Roberts said that Cricket Australia, a not-for-profit organisation, can’t keep paying people full time salaries to not work. “People wouldn’t have been engaged in many cases at all and in some cases, part time, in the normal activities that would happen in this period of the year. We’ve had two tours cancelled. We have various training programs cancelled and other activities cancelled. That is what led us to this particular point.” Roberts is less clear on why the COVID lockdown, an episode which began after Cricket Australia had staged all but one of last summer's international matches, triggered a financial crisis within the game. According to Roberts, the net impact of the pandemic so far is a $20 million reduction in Cricket Australia’s cash and investment reserves. The grounding of international and interstate travel, including a women’s tour to South Africa and men’s tour to Bangladesh, has saved CA about $20 million. This means that, since March, the pandemic has stripped in the order of $40 million from CA’s accounts. Where has the money gone? There was a loss caused by the cancelled one day international against New Zealand and Cricket Australia has needed to find more money to bankroll the operations of its T20 World Cup organising committee, which must keep preparing for the possibility of a tournament this summer but can't raise funds through ticket sales or events. Roberts says the largest single loss to Cricket Australia, about $10 million, is from a sharp depreciation of its investment fund since February. However, that loss will only be realised if Cricket Australia is forced to sell its shares. Roberts remains hopeful that it won’t. The final, COVID-related hit to Cricket Australia’s finances nominated by Roberts is “bad debtors”; the prospect of corporate partners and other debtors being unable to meet their payments. Cricket sources say the assumed loss from bad debtors is estimated to be close to $20 million. Roberts is unwilling to disclose the details of Cricket Australia’s sponsorship arrangements but says the full impact of the pandemic on the sports market is still to be felt. India are due to tour again this summer - but possibly to empty grounds.Credit:Scott Barbour “What has been incurred thus far is not the lion’s share of it. We are obviously anticipating an ongoing impact, like many organisations, in terms of our debtors. We are looking at the current trends and anticipating what that means in the current months.” This is the looming, billion-dollar question for cricket and other professional sports. India is due to tour this summer but if they come, they will almost certainly play before empty stadiums. The last time India played a Test series here, nearly half a million people walked through the turnstiles. The difference to Cricket Australia is about $50 million. The difference to sponsors and broadcasters is potentially of even greater significance. Chip Le Grand is The Age’s chief reporter.

The last time India played a Test series here, nearly half a million people walked through the turnstiles. The difference to Cricket Australia is about $50 million. The difference to sponsors and broadcasters is potentially of even greater significance. Chip Le Grand is The Age’s chief reporter.

Kerlies Sportzfan was an ode to his love of basketball and the NBA, which at the time occupied a small niche in the mostly inward-looking Australian sporting mindset. It was a mission for the 1972 Olympian, who would win four NBL crowns as a head coach, just to stock the store. He would travel to the US and bring merchandise back in his suitcase, then ask any friends on holidays or business to do the same. Replay   When it did hit the shelves, it was hardly flying out the door. His store was more of an oasis for dedicated basketball heads who would salivate over the silky moves of James Worthy or Larry Bird's automatic mid-range jumper. Then the tidal wave already sweeping the NBA crashed into the other side of the Pacific. The infiltration was more measured in reality but, at the time, it felt the NBA was a curiosity one day, a mainstream indulgence the next. ""It just exploded. Sometimes, I was selling 100 Bulls singlets and 100 Bulls shorts and 20-30 Bulls caps a day in the school holidays,"" Kerle says. ""I couldn’t keep up the demand. It was phenomenal, it was incredible. But it was all Jordan. There was Magic (Johnson) and Larry, that helped, but Jordan, that was a phenomenon. Kids loved him. It seemed like five out of 10 kids were wearing Bulls gear at one point."" If the first two episodes of the stunning new documentary series The Last Dance, which chronicles the final season of Chicago's six NBA titles in the Jordan era, evoked anything outside of the reminder that he loved winning and was excellent at basketball, it was a nostalgic refresher of the sheer force with which Jordan's celebrity devoured global sports culture. Australia was a particularly receptive market. In an era with minimal local TV exposure, no internet or social media, Jordan was the centre of a relentless branding machine powered by Nike that supercharged basketball's popularity and made His Airness the world's most famous athlete. ""Anything with his logo or name, that would fly out the door,"" Kerle said. ""It was great times … it really was. It was everything Chicago Bulls. Videos, posters … anything. You could put it on a postage stamp or a gum leaf and I would have been able to sell it. ""He had a tremendous impact on the game. He’s not the only one but he’s the most important figure in the history of the sport. Nobody will ever emulate what Jordan did for the game."" Locally, the basketball scene and the NBL was already enjoying an upsurge in popularity when the Bulls were hurtling towards their first championship in 1990-91.

As this goes to press the NRL is still resolute on restarting the comp on May 28 even as every other industry involving close contact is shut down. They will, we are assured, wash their hands both before and afterwards. Replay   And look, don’t you worry, rugby league players have a long history of sticking to the rules, and are famous for always taking sensible precautions against misadventure. Hey, I got a million of them! But seriously, folks. Essentially, the NRL chair Peter V’landys is arguing the case of rugby league exceptionalism, that the social isolation rules that apply to everyone else should not apply to them. AFL has much less contact than NRL and even they can’t contemplate coming back before July. In response to the NRL's insistence, however, both the Queensland and Victorian premiers have been clear: “Not on your Nelly.” With commendable leadership they have dismissed it out of hand and Channel Nine – a little late in the piece and maybe for not entirely the same reasons – is also not convinced. Who is missing right now is the NSW government. I think. For I cannot follow it. I believe we had, yes, the Police Commissioner signing a letter saying it was OK? Or maybe that was the Health Minister signing a letter giving a big tick to the police force? The point is, where are you, Premier Gladys? Does this get the go-ahead, or not? Are some people going to be still banned from seeing Grandma through anything bar a centimetre of glass, while others are not allowed to even attend the funerals of their nearest and dearest, but . . . But it is OK for the rugby league lads to wrestle sweat and burst breath all over each other for five or six days a week, before they go home to their families? Is that your position? If so, I respectfully ask: What is your own case for rugby league exceptionalism? Rugby league returning on May 28 is 'absolute madness', says Peter FitzSimons.Credit:AAP If it is good enough for them, why is it not good enough for the rest of us? Personally, this seems to me to be absolute madness, Premier. If you are going to open things up, so be it. But giving the green light to rugby league while the rest of us will have been stuck on red at the traffic lights for the past two months seems to be taking an insane and unnecessary risk. Essentially, the NRL chair Peter V’landys is arguing the case of rugby league exceptionalism, that the social isolation rules that apply to everyone else should not apply to them.Credit:John Shakespeare With the admittedly huge exception of the Ruby Princess, your government has done well on coronavirus. But are you really going to be forcing the resignation of your own Minister, Don Harwin, and nailing a $1000 fine to his head, just for going to his own holiday home on the Central Coast – you negligent bastard, how dare you!? – while saying that from late next week the leaguies are good to start training? We know rugby league has sway in this town, but does it have that much sway? That would be like saying proper resources for community and kids sport can get nicked, while we put billions of dollars to stadiums for rugby league and . . . And, oh, wait! Gladys, it is a nonsense, and you must know it. If you give the green light to league, you must give the green light to us all. If that is the case, can we all be told, too? At the very least you, and the NRL, have to make a compelling case for rugby league exceptionalism. Right now, it ain’t obvious. In the wake of Nick Farr-Jones and me firing shots from opposite sides of the rugby parapet this week, I have been bemused by several people wondering how we are going as friends? The answer is – notwithstanding a few tight, taut texts – fine! The position remains, either he will carry my coffin, or I will carry his. We have disagreed many on things for exactly 40 years, this year, and if this disagreement is stronger than most, so be it. I strongly disagree with his contention that Raelene Castle pulled the wrong rein on Israel Folau, as it obvious to me and most that in the face of that conflagration she and the board had no choice but to react the way they did. I have no clue specifically what the 10 Wallaby captains want the new board and new CEO to do that the old board and former CEO weren’t doing, beyond the motherhood blandishments contained in the letter. And I equally think that the optics of the 11 captains – Michael Lynagh later withdrew his signature – signing the letter 24 hours before Ms Castle was harassed from office were terrible. Whoever takes over from Castle – Farr-Jones is publically pushing hard for Phil Kearns – will have an enormous job ahead to bring the rugby community back together and convince the mob that it is not a case of the boys from Boys Club breaking the door down and charging in so they can be put back in charge. But against all that, I equally accept that the collective motivation of the signatories of the letter was only for the good of rugby. Farr-Jones personally remains the greatest and longest-standing servant of the game in Australia and has my deep respect for that, among many things. In short, rugby supporters, stay tuned. We will be back, after this brief brawl. The biography Anna Meares: Now came out this week, and there are some cracker yarns in it. It was a few weeks out from the 2012 London Olympics see, and our greatest ever track cyclist was about to take on not just Great Britain’s world champion, Victoria Pendleton, aka ‘Queen Victoria’, but her parochial British fans as well. It is daunting, but her coach Nick Flyger has an idea. Why not approach John Eales, who is working with the Australian Olympic team as an athlete liaison officer … Anna Meares at the London 2012 Olympic Games.Credit:Brendan Esposito “He has faced the New Zealand haka,” says Flyger. “If you’re going to face Victoria Pendleton in front of her home crowd, then you need to take some gold from him.” It is all arranged. “So, John, what was your secret?” Anna asks. Eales explains. It’s all about the set-up. Let them do their haka, their explosions of joy and rage and all the rest. But . . . But then sort yourself to have enough time between the finish of the haka, and the start of the match. In the case of the Wallabies it was wearing the track-suits for the haka, and then taking your time taking them off and lining up for the kick-off. In your case, Anna, you’ll work it out. Done. For the gold medal race at the velodrome in London, where the crowd noise reached levels akin to that of a jet plane, Pendleton is first on the track. Where is Anna? She and her coach are still on the edge of track, discussing tactics. By the time they reach the start, the crowd has gone quiet. Queen Victoria looks nervous. Anna charges to a famous victory. A happy ending? Yes, and it gets happier still. She and Nick Flyger are now a couple and in February welcomed their first child, a daughter named Evelyn. Raelene Castle resigns as CEO of Rugby Australia: “In the last couple of hours, it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need. The game is bigger than any one individual — so this evening I told the chair [Paul McLean] that I would resign from the role.” Todd Greenberg: “It has been my great honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last 4 years. Despite the variety of challenges and pressures I have loved every single minute of the journey. Our growth over the last 4 years has been extraordinary and I am very proud of my contribution to the game.”  @Steele_sports comments on Twitter, as the second CEO of a major football code bites the dust in three days: “First Covid-19 now the sequel CEO-2.” @marty_McFly_01: “No live action so league and union engage in a foot-shooting contest.” I think rugby union is just ahead at the moment, but it may have to come down to golden point. Who shoots the last little toe off first, wins. Excerpt from the letter signed by a slew of Wallaby captains and sent to incumbent chair Paul McLean: “In recent times, the Australian game has lost its way. It is a defeat inflicted not by COVID-19, or an on-field foe, but rather by poor administration and leadership over a number of years. We speak as one voice when we say Australian rugby needs new vision, leadership and a plan for the future. That plan must involve, as a priority, urgent steps to create a much-needed, sustainable, commercial rugby business.” Michael Lynagh withdrew his name the next morning. Tony Shaw, himself a distinguished Wallaby captain, on the letter signed by his brethren: “I'm gobsmacked. Why put it in the public domain when you have a chairman, who was a captain, just like you, who's done every job in rugby known to man – from player, captain, coach, administrator and president – and worked his butt off to work through the pandemic fallout in a short time frame?” Peter V’Landys won’t replace Greenberg with himself: “I’ve made that clear that I won’t do it. I’m not interested in it and I’ve never been interested in doing it. I don’t think it’s appropriate: there needs to be a segregation between the board and management. I’ve always believed in proper corporate governance, so it would be hypocritical to do anything other than that.” A Nine spokesperson on the NRL’s intended restart on May 28: “Although we agree constructive discussions have been held between the NRL, Nine and Foxtel, we feel it's premature to be confirming a start date at this stage.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in response to the NRL’s claim that the governments have signed off on the plan to restart the comp: “There is no detailed plan. I call on the NRL to submit that detailed plan and I will immediately forward it to [Queensland Chief Health Officer] Dr Young for her consideration and to report back to me.” Marty McFly, one of the Twitterati: “So a couple of hundred players, staff, broadcasting types and assorted hangers on can gather for a game of league but only a handful of my mates can see me off if I drop dead tomorrow? Working man’s game?” Cricket umpire Ian Gould on Australian cricket eventually crossing the line: “I believe Australia were out of control leading up to the ball-tampering issues. Deep down, we [umpires] let them down in that we should have nailed them three years previously but we let it go, let it go, let it go and it just exploded.” Australian cyclist Rohan Dennis on social media. He later deleted his accounts: “Day 34 - cracked and left the house. #covid19 can suck my ass and so can #quarantine.” I protest. Among other things, in Australia, it is spelt “arse.” Arsenal supporter Aaron Hughes on Chelsea player Jorginho sending a personal message to his girlfriend: “He’s Chelsea’s vice-captain and gives off this family-man image and there he is sending texts to my girlfriend. What sort of example is that? What made it even worse, as an Arsenal fan, was to see him score against us in December. They ended up winning. That just added to my pain.” Collingwood football star Mason Cox, an American, after watching a protester against isolation in his homeland proclaim, “What do I say to the science? I say I don’t believe your science, because I believe my God.” “Well after seeing that I don’t know that I’m ever going to leave Australia again. US, it’s been real but I’m out.” Todd Greenberg. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Raelene Castle. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Peter V’Landys. His psychological grip on the denizens of rugby league seems to have strengthened in recent weeks. Odd that a bloke unknown to the broad mass of the league community – at least as a football figure – until a couple of years ago should now be the one laying down the law and cracking the whip even to people who’ve been in the game for 40 years! Liverpool. Never do things the easy way. Without Corona, they would have, I’m told, won the league a long time ago. Peter FitzSimons is a journalist and columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald.

Raelene Castle resigns as CEO of Rugby Australia: “In the last couple of hours, it has been made clear to me that the board believes my no longer being the CEO would help give them the clear air they believe they need. The game is bigger than any one individual — so this evening I told the chair [Paul McLean] that I would resign from the role.” Todd Greenberg: “It has been my great honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last 4 years. Despite the variety of challenges and pressures I have loved every single minute of the journey. Our growth over the last 4 years has been extraordinary and I am very proud of my contribution to the game.”  @Steele_sports comments on Twitter, as the second CEO of a major football code bites the dust in three days: “First Covid-19 now the sequel CEO-2.” @marty_McFly_01: “No live action so league and union engage in a foot-shooting contest.” I think rugby union is just ahead at the moment, but it may have to come down to golden point. Who shoots the last little toe off first, wins. Excerpt from the letter signed by a slew of Wallaby captains and sent to incumbent chair Paul McLean: “In recent times, the Australian game has lost its way. It is a defeat inflicted not by COVID-19, or an on-field foe, but rather by poor administration and leadership over a number of years. We speak as one voice when we say Australian rugby needs new vision, leadership and a plan for the future. That plan must involve, as a priority, urgent steps to create a much-needed, sustainable, commercial rugby business.” Michael Lynagh withdrew his name the next morning. Tony Shaw, himself a distinguished Wallaby captain, on the letter signed by his brethren: “I'm gobsmacked. Why put it in the public domain when you have a chairman, who was a captain, just like you, who's done every job in rugby known to man – from player, captain, coach, administrator and president – and worked his butt off to work through the pandemic fallout in a short time frame?” Peter V’Landys won’t replace Greenberg with himself: “I’ve made that clear that I won’t do it. I’m not interested in it and I’ve never been interested in doing it. I don’t think it’s appropriate: there needs to be a segregation between the board and management. I’ve always believed in proper corporate governance, so it would be hypocritical to do anything other than that.” A Nine spokesperson on the NRL’s intended restart on May 28: “Although we agree constructive discussions have been held between the NRL, Nine and Foxtel, we feel it's premature to be confirming a start date at this stage.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in response to the NRL’s claim that the governments have signed off on the plan to restart the comp: “There is no detailed plan. I call on the NRL to submit that detailed plan and I will immediately forward it to [Queensland Chief Health Officer] Dr Young for her consideration and to report back to me.” Marty McFly, one of the Twitterati: “So a couple of hundred players, staff, broadcasting types and assorted hangers on can gather for a game of league but only a handful of my mates can see me off if I drop dead tomorrow? Working man’s game?” Cricket umpire Ian Gould on Australian cricket eventually crossing the line: “I believe Australia were out of control leading up to the ball-tampering issues. Deep down, we [umpires] let them down in that we should have nailed them three years previously but we let it go, let it go, let it go and it just exploded.” Australian cyclist Rohan Dennis on social media. He later deleted his accounts: “Day 34 - cracked and left the house. #covid19 can suck my ass and so can #quarantine.” I protest. Among other things, in Australia, it is spelt “arse.” Arsenal supporter Aaron Hughes on Chelsea player Jorginho sending a personal message to his girlfriend: “He’s Chelsea’s vice-captain and gives off this family-man image and there he is sending texts to my girlfriend. What sort of example is that? What made it even worse, as an Arsenal fan, was to see him score against us in December. They ended up winning. That just added to my pain.” Collingwood football star Mason Cox, an American, after watching a protester against isolation in his homeland proclaim, “What do I say to the science? I say I don’t believe your science, because I believe my God.” “Well after seeing that I don’t know that I’m ever going to leave Australia again. US, it’s been real but I’m out.” Todd Greenberg. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Raelene Castle. Started the week as the CEO of Rugby Australia. Finished it, like too many Australians right now, unemployed. Peter V’Landys. His psychological grip on the denizens of rugby league seems to have strengthened in recent weeks. Odd that a bloke unknown to the broad mass of the league community – at least as a football figure – until a couple of years ago should now be the one laying down the law and cracking the whip even to people who’ve been in the game for 40 years! Liverpool. Never do things the easy way. Without Corona, they would have, I’m told, won the league a long time ago. Peter FitzSimons is a journalist and columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald.

Consider the king-hit on Raelene Castle on Thursday. For 24 hours, she had been excluded from phone hook-ups with staff and directors. On Thursday, she gave an interview to the ABC’s 7.30 program in which she said the usual things about continuing to run the game in the face of her personal critics and the underlying problems, namely that the professional code, coronavirus or no coronavirus, is rooted. Replay   This interview was allowed to happen even while the board was about to let her know that she had lost their confidence. Oh dear, but the interview had already been recorded. Leigh Sales broke the news of Castle’s resignation on 7.30, and then played the interview, which was now as redundant as its subject. Talk about amateur hour. The sooner everyone in rugby is back working for nothing, the more honest a game it will be. The COVID-19 crisis, as we’re all finding out, is an unfolding drama of revelation. We are finding out what people and institutions are made of. In this killing season for chief executives, rugby has shown that it was still true to its cultural roots: private schoolboys too brain-dead to organise a piss-up on Zoom. No, that’s too harsh on schoolboys. Whatever your opinion of Castle’s performance during her three-year tenure, positive or negative, her resignation laid bare a degree of disorganisation that, frankly, would be an embarrassment to most suburban clubs. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  Days earlier, rugby league had shown how to do it. Again, whatever the rights and wrongs, whatever the agendas behind Todd Greenberg’s removal, whatever the cold-bloodedness of the Game of Thrones drama that he lost, whatever Greenberg’s overall legacy may be, it can be said that the NRL carries out its executions skilfully. Greenberg and his chairman, Peter V’landys, put out an unconvincing but tight statement of mutuality, and then Greenberg donned a smile and told the public he was proud of his tenure and would remain league’s biggest fan. He was given as dignified a departure as circumstances allowed. He was put away with a swift thrust of a shiv up under the ribcage. Castle, by contrast, was carved up by blind butchers with a blunt blade. You couldn’t make this one up. The black comedy had started with an open letter signed by 11, no 10, former Wallaby captains whingeing from the sidelines, offering no solutions other than bleating for a change of leadership. (Hey, isn’t that the media’s job?) As a coup, it was akin to the officers of the Titanic coming to the realisation that the best response to the hole in the hull was to seize the wheel from the captain and turn back for Southampton. Former Wallaby teammates Phil Kearns and Nick Farr-Jones were both in the halls of power throughout many of rugby's recent dramas.Credit:Simon Aleka Then there was the identification of Nick Farr-Jones and Phil Kearns as the strongest personalities behind the letter. Where were they when the game was heading for the iceberg? In its boardrooms. If Farr-Jones were in a position of influence, then Israel Folau would still be playing for the Wallabies and continuing to speak from a place of love. Only he wouldn’t, because the Wallabies wouldn’t have any sponsors, and if there’s one thing we know about Folau, it’s that he’s not going to hang around in a sport without any money. But apparently Folau’s place of love was Raelene Castle’s fault. Competence no longer mattered. The gentlemen’s club had gathered together and stamped their feet. Farr-Jones’s standing comes from the fact that he was one of the greatest Wallabies. There is no doubt about his distinction on the field. He has backed a push for his fellow Newington College Old Boy Kearns to become CEO. Kearns was also an iconic Wallaby, a World Cup winner in Farr-Jones’s team best known for sticking it up his All Blacks opposite number Sean Fitzpatrick back in 1990. An inspiring moment from the amateur era. On the other hand, Kearns’s capacity for original, insightful thinking and articulate understanding of the game has been on public display every week for Fox Sports. The open letter upheld anyone’s ideal of amateurism, right down to counting the numbers. And then there were 10. Michael ‘Noddy’ Lynagh, who received Farr-Jones’s bullet-like passes for so many years, had signed the letter and booted it downfield without reading the fine print. Or the large print. Noddy nodded along and nodded off. His personal fortune is currently on its way to Nigeria. Todd Greenberg and Raelene Castle, pictured here in happier times in 2013 when the former took over from Greenberg at the Bulldogs, both lost their jobs this week.Credit:Wolter Peeters At least Lynagh had the courage to swallow his embarrassment and back out publicly. That took guts. As a dissenter, he joined the other captains who did not sign the letter: John Eales, Mark Ella, Tony Shaw, Mark Loane, Phil Waugh, Tim Horan, David Wilson and Grand Slam winner Andrew Slack. Plenty of grise on both sides, but more eminence among the non-signatories. If this was a failed coup, its disorganisation, poor tactical sense, questionable motives and absence of content were a combined masterstroke. Competence no longer mattered. The gentlemen’s club had gathered together and stamped their feet. Over at the NRL, Greenberg said he was proud of his legacy of encouraging inclusiveness in league. He didn’t invent inclusiveness, but he recognised that it is an underlying force that is going to outlive all the daily skirmishes and revolving-door managers. Rugby, two days later, sacrificed a chief executive in the name of exclusiveness. Those who thought Folau never did anything wrong have now received their payback. As rugby’s constituency shrinks back to its true-blue heartland, Mosman rules. Rugby was for years the sick man of Australian sport, but now it’s just the one that’s been in the hospital ward the longest. It’s been joined by a few mates. The sky has fallen in on all sports democratically, but they are all showing their true character. Rugby league is about the ruthless pursuit of self-interest and bending the rules to its advantage. Rugby union is about restoring a mythical past. Cricket – we’ll get to cricket another day. Truth is, the day the CEO of Rugby Australia arrives in their office they are served up a big poo sandwich. Castle, like Bill Pulver before her, put in years of earnest effort but was ultimately not judged to be eating that sandwich in a sufficiently manly, Wallaby style. Someone else will be found to do it. Let’s hope it isn’t one of those dogs who chase cars all day, only, when the car stops for them, to have no idea what to do with it. At these times, when all are left lying in the same gutter looking at the same stars, it might not make much difference who takes stewardship of a game’s decline. When solvency is the issue, big names and big egos aren’t going to register. The Sydney-based gentlemen’s club has reasserted its prerogatives. Now it’s full-steam ahead to 1991.

106,/sport/nrl/is-this-the-way-it-s-gonna-be-forever-why-a-league-tsar-must-be-born-20200424-p54mx6.html,Is this the way it's gonna be forever? Why a league tsar must be born,"The crow; that sable, most evil-eyed of all birds. There weren’t any black crows circling the skies just after Christmas. Two days after Santa upended his sack, I went to see Cold Chisel do their thing (sans vodka) at Marrickville in the kind of place where the soles of your going-out Havaianas stick to the floor; where a Southern Comfort n’ Marlboro-fuelled bashing might erupt the very next second, if people had enough room to swing a punch. Departing down a rickety staircase, from a fair distance I spied Todd Greenberg and his wife. I don’t know Todd; I’ve met him maybe twice, however some of the people I was with that night know him better than most. The harbingers of disaster weren’t spiralling the skies throughout Sydney, that summer’s night. But my word, how the world can upend itself. Four short months, and … here we are. The whole world has properly shat itself; maybe changed forever. Rugby league though? It’s Groundhog Day all over again. Replay   Cast your mind back to 2012, David Gallop was speared all because he was too “reactive”. Three-and-a-bit years later Dave Smith was jettisoned, all because he’d (apparently) forced the NRL into resembling a quasi merchant bank - the real reason of course, is that he’d the temerity to magnificently piss off Jerry Hall’s now-husband (kudos, where it’s due). Shane Mattiske, who’d filled in on an interim basis after Gallop’s departure, wasn’t given half a chance. But there’s more. Removing (he quit, technically) John Grant in early 2018, from his position as the inaugural chairman of the much-vaunted ARL Commission, was somehow supposed to be the magic bullet to cure league’s financial problems. The excision of Grant, on the imprimatur of a cabal of NRL clubs, was in the offing for years. As if Grant’s penchant for chauffeur-driven limousines constituted rugby league’s money bonfire. So Grant departed, anointing former Queensland premier Peter Beattie as his replacement. That experiment was lamentably unsuccessful; the ascension of Peter V’Landys was swift, and for the good. Greenberg is the latest, in an extending conga line of accomplished people, chewed up and spat out, by that special beast that is rugby league. And for what tangible benefit, exactly? Sure, Greenberg technically “resigned”. One expects he had a clause inserted in his employment contract stating that he could do exactly that, on providing around six months’ notice. That the ARL Commission doesn’t require him to work out his notice period isn’t surprising; however the game remains on the hook to pay out approximately six months’ remuneration to its departed former chief executive. At 100 cents in the dollar. And good luck to Greenberg, given the shabby way he’s been treated. Todd Greenberg's exit as the latest in a long line of former NRL bosses highlights the game's need for a Bernie Eccletsone-type figure.Credit:Getty And sure, the cessation of Greenberg’s tenure bluntly signals to broadcasters and other stakeholders that a new sheriff’s in town. But seriously, you wanna know what’s probably going on here? If it’s true as has been reported, that rugby league’s broadcast agreements include “Act of God” or force majeure provisions, then that’s a good thing. If those clauses permit the NRL characterising the COVID-19 pandemic as an event beyond its control, preventing it from meeting its core contractual obligation to supply match content to be televised and streamed, then that’s better than being in breach of contract. But force majeure clauses typically also include a sting in the tail; a provision that says that if the unforeseeable circumstances preventing compliance with a contract’s terms continue to exist for longer than a specified period - say 90 days, or longer - the non-affected party (sometimes either party) can elect to terminate the whole deal. The NRL competition was suspended on March 23; it’s slated to definitely, maybe resume on May 28.  That’s a 66-day period. It isn’t inconceivable that rugby league’s broadcasters - including Channel Nine, publishers of this masthead - have the subsisting contractual right to walk away entirely from broadcasting rugby league, if the game doesn’t resume this side of 30 June. That would be an unmitigated disaster. Which could explain the very urgency of the conceptualisation of Project Apollo, and even the skewering of Todd Greenberg; an act of appeasement towards broadcasters, in limbo-land with nothing to actually broadcast. The demise of Gallop, Smith and Greenberg inevitably will be the path the next appointee will one day tread. What I’m absolutely more certain about though, is this. Any future candidate, fortunate enough to be in the position of having to choose whether to drink from the poisoned chalice ought take due pause, for serious thought. If rugby league were a wild animal, it’d be a species that delights in the eating of its own flesh and blood even if not hungry. The demise of Gallop, Smith, Greenberg inevitably will be the path the next appointee will one day tread. The reason I’m so convinced is that structurally, rugby league is governed from a platform constructed entirely of matchsticks and prayers. Its currency is enmity, distrust and revenge.Once heralded as the “independent commission” governance model so desperately required - which vested absolute controlling powers in the ARL Commission’s directors, free of conflicting interests and influences - rugby league’s byzantine corporate structure is anything but independent. It requires a crisis for such weaknesses to be laid bare. The elemental flaw is that rugby league essentially is, but can’t possibly function properly as, a democracy. Even a majority of clubs, vociferously hectoring about perceived unfair treatment by the game’s CEO, can’t be the basis for that chief’s employment ending. Mark my words, it’ll happen to whomever under the current structure next occupies the big chair. These forces are omnipotent and destructive, for no overall benefit. Rugby league doesn’t need another chief executive, as much as it desperately requires structural modification to quell the chorus of the distrust brigade. It’s nonsense to think that now Greenberg’s head is impaled on the proverbial stick, somehow that’ll cure whatever woe has befallen the game by reason of the coronavirus pandemic and the virus’ remarkable efficiency, in revealing its woes. Constitutional change would be required for Peter V'landys to become all-powerful in rugby league.Credit:AAP Frankly, rugby league will thrive once governed not by a board of directors however intelligent and experienced, or a chief executive and senior management team who are (hopefully) even more polished and experienced. Instead, the egg needs to be cracked and scrambled - what the greatest game of all actually needs, is a tsar. A singular, all-power wielding executive chairman. Or commissioner, or whatever title you want to assign to the role. A person who - once identified and appointed - is bestowed absolute, constitutional decision-making responsibility AND power, exercisable without the necessity to report to boards, sub-committees and clubs without fear of removal. Which isn’t to say that consultation with stakeholders is forbidden; just that it’s not a required integer of decision-making. North Korea, without the bizarro haircuts.

Why a league tsar must be born,"The crow; that sable, most evil-eyed of all birds. There weren’t any black crows circling the skies just after Christmas. Two days after Santa upended his sack, I went to see Cold Chisel do their thing (sans vodka) at Marrickville in the kind of place where the soles of your going-out Havaianas stick to the floor; where a Southern Comfort n’ Marlboro-fuelled bashing might erupt the very next second, if people had enough room to swing a punch. Departing down a rickety staircase, from a fair distance I spied Todd Greenberg and his wife. I don’t know Todd; I’ve met him maybe twice, however some of the people I was with that night know him better than most. The harbingers of disaster weren’t spiralling the skies throughout Sydney, that summer’s night. But my word, how the world can upend itself. Four short months, and … here we are. The whole world has properly shat itself; maybe changed forever. Rugby league though? It’s Groundhog Day all over again. Replay   Cast your mind back to 2012, David Gallop was speared all because he was too “reactive”. Three-and-a-bit years later Dave Smith was jettisoned, all because he’d (apparently) forced the NRL into resembling a quasi merchant bank - the real reason of course, is that he’d the temerity to magnificently piss off Jerry Hall’s now-husband (kudos, where it’s due). Shane Mattiske, who’d filled in on an interim basis after Gallop’s departure, wasn’t given half a chance. But there’s more. Removing (he quit, technically) John Grant in early 2018, from his position as the inaugural chairman of the much-vaunted ARL Commission, was somehow supposed to be the magic bullet to cure league’s financial problems. The excision of Grant, on the imprimatur of a cabal of NRL clubs, was in the offing for years. As if Grant’s penchant for chauffeur-driven limousines constituted rugby league’s money bonfire. So Grant departed, anointing former Queensland premier Peter Beattie as his replacement. That experiment was lamentably unsuccessful; the ascension of Peter V’Landys was swift, and for the good. Greenberg is the latest, in an extending conga line of accomplished people, chewed up and spat out, by that special beast that is rugby league. And for what tangible benefit, exactly? Sure, Greenberg technically “resigned”. One expects he had a clause inserted in his employment contract stating that he could do exactly that, on providing around six months’ notice. That the ARL Commission doesn’t require him to work out his notice period isn’t surprising; however the game remains on the hook to pay out approximately six months’ remuneration to its departed former chief executive. At 100 cents in the dollar. And good luck to Greenberg, given the shabby way he’s been treated. Todd Greenberg's exit as the latest in a long line of former NRL bosses highlights the game's need for a Bernie Eccletsone-type figure.Credit:Getty And sure, the cessation of Greenberg’s tenure bluntly signals to broadcasters and other stakeholders that a new sheriff’s in town. But seriously, you wanna know what’s probably going on here? If it’s true as has been reported, that rugby league’s broadcast agreements include “Act of God” or force majeure provisions, then that’s a good thing. If those clauses permit the NRL characterising the COVID-19 pandemic as an event beyond its control, preventing it from meeting its core contractual obligation to supply match content to be televised and streamed, then that’s better than being in breach of contract. But force majeure clauses typically also include a sting in the tail; a provision that says that if the unforeseeable circumstances preventing compliance with a contract’s terms continue to exist for longer than a specified period - say 90 days, or longer - the non-affected party (sometimes either party) can elect to terminate the whole deal. The NRL competition was suspended on March 23; it’s slated to definitely, maybe resume on May 28.  That’s a 66-day period. It isn’t inconceivable that rugby league’s broadcasters - including Channel Nine, publishers of this masthead - have the subsisting contractual right to walk away entirely from broadcasting rugby league, if the game doesn’t resume this side of 30 June. That would be an unmitigated disaster. Which could explain the very urgency of the conceptualisation of Project Apollo, and even the skewering of Todd Greenberg; an act of appeasement towards broadcasters, in limbo-land with nothing to actually broadcast. The demise of Gallop, Smith and Greenberg inevitably will be the path the next appointee will one day tread. What I’m absolutely more certain about though, is this. Any future candidate, fortunate enough to be in the position of having to choose whether to drink from the poisoned chalice ought take due pause, for serious thought. If rugby league were a wild animal, it’d be a species that delights in the eating of its own flesh and blood even if not hungry. The demise of Gallop, Smith, Greenberg inevitably will be the path the next appointee will one day tread. The reason I’m so convinced is that structurally, rugby league is governed from a platform constructed entirely of matchsticks and prayers. Its currency is enmity, distrust and revenge.Once heralded as the “independent commission” governance model so desperately required - which vested absolute controlling powers in the ARL Commission’s directors, free of conflicting interests and influences - rugby league’s byzantine corporate structure is anything but independent. It requires a crisis for such weaknesses to be laid bare. The elemental flaw is that rugby league essentially is, but can’t possibly function properly as, a democracy. Even a majority of clubs, vociferously hectoring about perceived unfair treatment by the game’s CEO, can’t be the basis for that chief’s employment ending. Mark my words, it’ll happen to whomever under the current structure next occupies the big chair. These forces are omnipotent and destructive, for no overall benefit. Rugby league doesn’t need another chief executive, as much as it desperately requires structural modification to quell the chorus of the distrust brigade. It’s nonsense to think that now Greenberg’s head is impaled on the proverbial stick, somehow that’ll cure whatever woe has befallen the game by reason of the coronavirus pandemic and the virus’ remarkable efficiency, in revealing its woes. Constitutional change would be required for Peter V'landys to become all-powerful in rugby league.Credit:AAP Frankly, rugby league will thrive once governed not by a board of directors however intelligent and experienced, or a chief executive and senior management team who are (hopefully) even more polished and experienced. Instead, the egg needs to be cracked and scrambled - what the greatest game of all actually needs, is a tsar. A singular, all-power wielding executive chairman. Or commissioner, or whatever title you want to assign to the role. A person who - once identified and appointed - is bestowed absolute, constitutional decision-making responsibility AND power, exercisable without the necessity to report to boards, sub-committees and clubs without fear of removal. Which isn’t to say that consultation with stakeholders is forbidden; just that it’s not a required integer of decision-making. North Korea, without the bizarro haircuts. Rugby league doesn’t need a guiding hand. It requires an autocrat, and fundamental corporate governance restructuring to vest such absolute powers. Whether any of the mooted candidates to replace Greenberg can perform the functions of that role, is highly questionable. V’Landys gives every indication that he could, but constitutional change would be required. There’s no use appointing V’Landys under the current structure.

Rennie had given no specific commitment to that end in the wake of Castle's sudden departure on Thursday, but nor had he given any indication his dedication was wavering, a Wallabies source told the Herald. Replay   The New Zealander, who is still contracted to Glasgow in the Pro14, has continued working closely with his Australian-based assistants on building out the Wallabies program. As speculation intensified around Castle's future, sources close to Rennie had warned twice over the past month that the former Chiefs coach may not be prepared to work under anyone other than the CEO who recruited him. When Castle handed in her resignation on Thursday evening, one of the first calls both she and director of rugby Scott Johnson made was to Rennie. A source described the coach's reaction as extremely disappointed but also understanding that best-laid plans can go awry and that he remained committed to coaching Australia. Incoming Wallabies coach Dave Rennie. Credit:AAP ""They had developed a friendship, it was an important relationship to both of them, so there was disappointment on Dave's part,"" the source said. ""But he is also a diligent man who acts with honour. He still wants to do the job."" It would be a major blow to Australian rugby if Rennie were to walk away from his deal, which was due to see him arrive in Australia in late June or early July. Asked whether Castle’s exit would affect Rennie's arrival, RA chairman Paul McLean said on Friday: “I haven’t spoken to Dave, I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago. [Director of rugby] Scott Johnson spoke to him last night. Raelene has spoken him as well.” Speaking on ABC’s 7.30 program before standing down on Thursday, Castle said she believed Rennie would honour his commitment. “I know he has a desperate desire to coach the Wallabies and he has done a lot of work in the time leading up to when he arrives,” Castle said. “He is excited about the young talent he sees coming through on our platforms. That was one of the major reasons he decided to sign with Rugby Australia and come here. “He will come here regardless of where I sit.” Even if Rennie does take the job, there is the issue of getting him to Australia due to border restrictions, depending on if and when Tests can be played this year. Meanwhile, it appears Castle's exit won’t change RA’s support for Gus Pichot at the upcoming World Rugby elections. McLean made it very clear Australia and other southern hemisphere national unions would not support incumbent chairman Bill Beaumont, who is running against Pichot, the former Argentinian halfback, in next month’s World Rugby Council meetings. The sticking point is the Nations Championship which never got off the ground. The competition would have pitted southern and northern hemisphere teams against one another but was knocked on the head by a number of Six Nations unions who were concerned about the promotion and relegation aspect and how it could affect their revenues. It means Beamount, the former England captain, won’t be on Australia’s ticket. “We were very disappointed that we didn’t get the global competition up and running last year. No greater interest than self interest,” McLean said. “We thought it would have been a defining moment in our game and it was well thought through. We thought it was a no-brainer. That didn’t happen and we made it clear that we were unhappy about that and the process. We stuck together and let it be known to the northern hemisphere. We think it should be revisited sooner rather than later.” Georgina Robinson is the chief rugby reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald.

109,/sport/nrl/lest-we-forget-what-a-difference-100-years-can-make-20200424-p54myv.html,Lest we forget what a difference 100 years can make,"On this Anzac Day 100 years ago, the most powerful man in Sydney racing was also chairman of rugby league’s peak body, rugby union was losing relevance and Aussie Rules officials in Melbourne remained mystified as to why their game had not won over the Harbour City. It was only 18 months after World War I ended and the Spanish flu, which claimed 12,000 lives in Australia - with NSW accounting for half the deaths - had almost disappeared.  A sense of optimism prevailed, just as Australians now are looking towards the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Replay   James Joynton Smith was president of the NSWRL and was soon to be made chair of the Advisory Committee on NSW Racing, making him the most powerful man in the sport. A century later, Peter V’landys is chair of the ARL Commission and chief executive of Racing NSW but, unlike Smith, is yet to be elected Lord Mayor of Sydney, nor knighted by Buckingham Palace for charitable works. However, they both launched their careers at Harold Park, with Smith owning it and V’landys based there when chief executive of the NSW Harness Racing Club. In a deal which V’landys would admire, Smith sold Harold Park to the NSW Rugby Union for 13,000 pounds. Rugby paid a deposit of 3000 pounds off the record gate takings of their 1907 season and Smith used the money to lure union stars across to rugby league which began in 1908. Minus their stars and with falling gate takings, while paying high interest rates to Smith, NSWRU was forced to sell Harold Park to V’landys’ future employer. By 1914, rugby league in Sydney was doing much better than rival codes, as the following profit figures for the season demonstrate: Representative games: rugby league 4252 pounds; rugby 348. Club matches: rugby league 8795 pounds, union 625, Aussie Rules 390. When World War I erupted in August 1914, the British government immediately discouraged the playing of all professional sports, arguing that it discouraged enlistments. Rugby league continued its competition, while rugby union suspended theirs. On the original Anzac Day in 1915, the NSWRL’s first secretary, Ted Larkin and his brother were killed at Gallipoli, fuelling acrimony over playing sport in a time of war. It is relevant to today’s debate over sport being played in a pandemic. Back then, the AJC kept racing and the NSWRL stated it wanted to ‘‘preserve the continuity of the game’’ and to ‘‘provide legitimate means of recreation for the players and patrons who were unable for one reason or another to serve.’’ Senior rugby league officials 100 years ago were also Labor members of parliament, with one newspaper describing the code as “the playground of NSW politicians.” NSW Labor Premier WA Holman took a view at odds with his anti-conscription colleagues, saying in July 1915 ‘‘Your comrades at Gallipoli are calling you. This is not the time for football or tennis matches. It is serious. Show that you realise this by enlisting at once.’’ It’s the National Party now which is supporting the NRL with former Racing Minister, Troy Grant, a member of V’landys’ Innovation Committee. NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro has also backed the NRL resuming saying “the NRL is the tonic we need to get through this virus.” Debate raged more than a century ago about whether rugby league should play on during WW1 just as Peter V'landys, right, and until recently Todd Greenberg have attempted to get the show back on the road amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Credit:AAP The code’s best players joined the debate, with Dally Messenger calling in June 1915 for football grounds to be converted to rifle ranges, while the NRL’s record-holder for most games, Cameron Smith, argued the NRL should halt play in the wider interest of protecting the community from the virus. By the time of the NSWRL’s AGM in March 1919, Joynton Smith was re-elected unopposed as president and announced assets of 5520 pounds and liabilities of only 27 pounds.  When V’landys assumed the chairmanship of the ARLC last year, he confronted a balance sheet of minimal assets and little cash. Rugby struggled to restart its competition after the war, while Smith had earlier flirted with Aussie Rules officials over a proposal, at their behest, to amalgamate the two codes. It sounds like heresy now but the man behind the merger was Charles Brownlow, after whom the AFL’s best and fairest award is named. Aussie Rules had held a carnival at the SCG which attracted a poor crowd, compared to the big attendance at the league, prompting Brownlow to argue a merger of the two codes would produce a magnificent spectacle. Plans to fuse the two codes were nicknamed “Brownlow’s Brainchild”. Secret talks between the codes- which took newspapers six months to reveal – came to nothing.The report of the meeting in Melbourne noted Brownlow asking ‘‘Don’t the clubs (in rugby league) cause trouble?’’. A Mr E Mead, representing the NSWRL, replied: ‘‘Very little notice is taken of their attitude.” Given that rugby league’s top administrator, Todd Greenberg, recently fell victim to a campaign by powerful NRL clubs, maybe the sporting world was radically different 100 years ago.

110,/sport/rugby-union/dark-forces-mclean-slams-castle-abusers-20200424-p54mvi.html,'Dark forces': McLean slams Castle abusers,"Rugby Australia chairman Paul McLean has lashed out at the “abhorrent” bullying of Raelene Castle during her time as chief executive, saying it upsets him that “dark forces” conspired to repeatedly undermine her during more than two years in charge. So bad was the vitriol in recent times McLean revealed a board meeting was organised on Wednesday evening without Castle to discuss a contingency plan if the Kiwi administrator decided she wanted to quit. Replay   It was in this meeting McLean said it became apparent the board felt it was best for Castle to stand down on what the former Wallabies captain described as a “tough day” on Thursday. McLean said he will briefly step up from his role as the interim RA chairman to become an executive chairman, with further decisions about ongoing leadership and the recruitment process for a new CEO to be made next week. McLean also said he still planned to stand down as interim chair before July 31, but that could be moved forward. “The immediate future of that role is being discussed,” McLean said. “I will adopt the role of executive chair for a very short period until such time as we meet the executive team on Monday and map out what the next steps might be in terms of either an interim CEO running in parallel with a program to seek a process to appoint a full-time CEO down the track.” McLean spoke strongly about his disgust at the personal attacks directed towards Castle during her time at the helm of RA. “I’m not a social media person but I’m aware of some of the things that were said over a period of time in a quite vicious and vitriolic way. It’s the silent forces, the dark forces, they’re the things that upset me most,” McLean told reporters via a teleconference on Friday. “It’s the people who didn’t know the facts or were just one of those faceless people out there - that was the damaging thing from her perspective. She shared some of that with me, which I found quite abhorrent. “One of my greatest concerns with her was her welfare and how she was on a daily basis. A lesser person would have thrown the towel in ages ago, quite simply. “The discussion that we had to have as a board [on Wednesday] is what is a succession plan if Raelene walked in or rang me one day and said ‘Paul, I’m gone, I can’t do this anymore’. I would have understood that. “We’ve had some broader discussions about that over the last six months and I suppose it crystallised with some new eyes around the board table and it probably crystallised given the circumstances we all face from a general economy. “Without the things that happened in the last two years and some of the unwarranted criticisms and bullying, I think it might have been a different scenario.” Asked whether he was comfortable with the board’s leadership when criticism was levelled at Castle, who was often made to be a scapegoat, McLean argued it was a tough situation. “If defending someone and doing it as best you can is not going to be news, you’re not going to get a run,” McLean said. “It was very difficult for us to get airtime in some of those areas. (Former RA chairman) Cameron Clyne finished up getting some space to write an article in one newspaper to even out the process and let people know what was actually happening. I don’t think it looked like that [criticism] was going to go away any time soon. Rugby Australia's Paul McLean and Raelene Castle.Credit:SMH It comes as Alan Jones continued his sustained criticism of Castle, saying on 2GB on Friday morning she ""knows nothing about the game"". McLean made it clear that a letter signed by 10 former Wallabies captains calling for the board to stand down did not influence the decision to punt Castle, and the Queenslander took a subtle swipe at his fellow ex-Test captains. “It’s a very small collective of people who have been involved in the game of late … the significance of that group is probably the people who aren’t on the list,” McLean said. “It’s great people want to put their hand up and be involved but they need to be part of the process. I think that group, the Nick Farr-Jones group, could easily - and I suggested to them - join in with that wider group [who want to help] very easily.""

The radio broadcaster and former Wallabies coach has been one of Castle's fiercest critics since she took the role in 2018, particularly over her handling of the Israel Folau saga. Replay   Castle resigned as RA boss on Thursday evening after a tumultuous few weeks and attention will now turn to the survival of a board that may also see a number of casualties during a precarious period for the code.

Dave Rennie at the helm, with internationally-experienced assistants Scott Wisemantel (ex-England) and Matt Taylor (ex-Scotland), Dean Benton and John Pryor (ex-Fiji) in charge of athletic development and Australia's most promising young head coach Dan McKellar in negotiations to join as forwards coach. Replay   That Castle, after resigning suddenly on Thursday evening, will have to watch someone else take credit for what successes Rennie and director of rugby Scott Johnson (also her recruit) might conjure is exquisitely unfair. But this is professional sport and that's life. It is worth putting on the public record one last time, however. In the midst of the coronavirus-induced chaos gripping all sports, and the bloodthirsty opportunism that rose up to meet it in rugby over recent weeks, Castle was blamed for all manner of structural, situational and cyclical problems facing the game. Some of which she had a hand in, some of which she didn't. Two years and three months in the job without a major, demonstrable victory completely eroded the board's confidence. It was not an explosive letter, signed by 10 Wallabies captains, calling for the administration to ""step aside"" this week that cost the former Bulldogs and Netball New Zealand boss her job. It added to the noise but ultimately two years and three months in the job without a major, demonstrable victory completely eroded the board's confidence. On top of that the past month of the coronavirus crisis, which saw her work 20-hour days to strip cost from the organisation and save the game from bankruptcy, put a spotlight on her shortcomings. Castle's stubborn refusal for three weeks to hand over the 2019 balance sheet to the players union as she pursued a pay deal was fatal and unnecessary, costing her the respect of almost all the senior players at a time she needed them onside. Tellingly it was the arrival of new director Peter Wiggs, to whom the board may now look to lead them in the short term, at the negotiating table last week that broke the deadlock. At the same time Wiggs and the other two new directors, Daniel Herbert and Brett Godfrey, were known to be underwhelmed by Castle's detailed knowledge of the business, a flaw brought to light when RA's survival came into question with the prospect of a worst-case scenario $120 million revenue hole if no rugby is played for the rest of the year. Raelene Castle was not always easy to defend, but few of the problems laid at her feet were of her own making.Credit:AAP As for many of the other bullets fired at the Australian-born New Zealander? Some are fair and some ignore the fact Castle's predecessors Bill Pulver and John O'Neill either created, or further entrenched, a business model for the game that saw it chase cash at the expense of competition integrity, all the while throwing bigger and bigger bags of money at players to ward off foreign raiders. Pulver had to torch 20 per cent of the country's professional footprint to save the code from bankruptcy. He stripped so much cost from the business that there was no high performance structure left to catch Ewen McKenzie when his Wallabies' tenure spiralled out of control in 2014. Desperate and with no sports administration experience to help him spot the flaws, Pulver installed Michael Cheika as his replacement, with a similar absence of oversight. But back to Castle. What of last year's $9.4 million loss, thrown around as if it is evidence of her mismanagement? It is hard to say for certain without seeing the books, which were not lodged with ASIC after last month's annual general meeting. But most likely 2019 was a year like any other World Cup year, in which a loss of that scale is forecast. In 2015 RA recorded a $9.8 million loss, and in 2011 it was a $10.6 million deficit. No broadcast deal for 2021? That sits at Castle's feet because she walked away from a $20 million a year offer from current partners Foxtel on the understanding there was broader market interest in rugby's five-yearly rights. But also rotten luck, because the coronavirus outbreak and global shutdown of sport torpedoed negotiations with Optus and free-to-air broadcaster Ten, right at a point when the telco was 48 hours from tabling a formal offer. The appointment of Scott Johnson as Australia's first director of rugby was one of the successes of Castle's reign.Credit:AAP The Israel Folau saga? A bit of both. Folau's repeated anti-gay comments on social media would have tested the best in the business and his ongoing exile from Australian sport proves her stance was correct. Settling out of court for a figure around the $4 million mark, to avoid a high-risk trial and a third season being drowned out by the controversy, was the right call. But her call to re-sign Folau for another four years after his April 2018 comments, on almost as much money - after the withdrawal of a private donor, no less - and then her bungling of that contract, went to the heart of her capacity to run a major sport. Castle trusted Folau and left the organisation with no contractual protection against a breach of that trust, when he doubled down with more anti-gay posts a year later. It meant defending rugby's values would come with a hefty price tag, and was a clear sign to many close observers that she lacked the attention to detail and shrewd pragmatism required for the role. Her poor relationship with Michael Cheika is another failure that can be chalked up to a combination of naivety and poor judgment. Castle made the calculated gamble she could ride out the final two years of the difficult Wallabies coach's contract while building back up the organisation's high performance structures and starting the search for his replacement, who would be her man. A year into her time at Moore Park, when she realised change was necessary, the board baulked. A dismal quarter-final exit at last year's World Cup and ugly verbal brawl at an official Australian Embassy function in Tokyo were the fruit borne of those decisions. It is also true that Castle was the victim of sexism from within the sport's old guard. A former Wallabies coach once told the Herald that Australian rugby couldn't be represented by a woman ""who looks like that"". Vile social media commentary based on gender and appearance trailed Castle's every move - and still does - and within a few months of her arrival at Moore Park a group of powerful former players decided they couldn't handle ""their"" game being run by an outsider, much less a Kiwi. But Castle was never an easy administrator to defend, because of all of the missteps outlined above. Just like Castle's rugby league counterpart, Todd Greenberg, who resigned the NRL post on Tuesday, the world-altering coronavirus swiftly laid bare the structural flaws of both games, and of both leaders. The Wallabies captains might have upped the pressure, but the reality was with rugby in trouble, the board had lost confidence that Castle was the person to lead them out of the mire.

A fed-up Peter V'landys has vowed to sort out the 2020 season by the end of Friday after describing recent commentary around the game's attempt to return as ""scaremongering and alarmist rhetoric"". The ARLC chairman, clearly angered by Channel Nine's statement describing a May 28 resumption date as ""premature"", said he was saving his ""best punches to the end"" in a emotion-charged interview with Today host Karl Stefanovic on Friday morning. Replay   ""This is like a boxing match, you take a few blows to the head, a few body blows, but you save your best punches to the end,"" V'landys said on the program. ""I think you'll find on the 28th of May we will start and we won't be a problem."" One of the main sticking points in broadcast negotiations between Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany and Nine boss Hugh Marks, apart from discussions about an extension, is the length of the this season. Channel Nine would prefer a shorter competition in 2020 of about 17 weeks while Fox Sports want as many games as possible and would be happy for the competition to run into November. V'landys has tried to play the role of peacemaker but the game's head honcho appears to be done with playing nice and has vowed not to leave his office today until a competition structure for 2020 is locked in. ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP ""We have two different broadcasters - one has a different view to the other,"" V'landys said. ""Today is D-Day for me. A decision will be made as to the length of the season between the two broadcasters. ""We will meet our contractual obligation to the broadcasters but a decision has to be made. The procrastination has been taking long enough. A decision will be made today."" At the core of V'landys' frustrations is a statement released by Nine on Thursday night, which is believed to have blindsided the game's chairman. NRL players are waiting to return to competition in 2020.Credit:Getty ""Although we agree constructive discussions have been held between the NRL, Nine and Foxtel, we feel it's premature to be confirming a start date at this stage,"" a Nine spokesperson said. ""There is a great will to work together to an outcome but a lot of work still to do. A deal needs to be completed and the structure of the competition locked [in], which importantly must include how it will operate within the health-and-safety standards currently affecting the community."" V'landys strongly opposes the notion that the NRL was risking the health of the players or the community by planning to return on May 28. ""Look at the data and the facts,"" he said. ""Don't look at emotion and scaremongering and emotional rhetoric. You've got to look at the facts, and the facts are for the last 12 days in NSW the infection rate has been less than 1 per cent. When we suspended play on the last round the infection rate was 25.5 per cent. ""The health experts then said we could play, so what is the difference? The difference is that it is much safer now, and it'll be safer in five weeks than it ever has been ... I think people have got to stop using this alarmist language. ""We have done our negotiation with government, we are applying to governments and we will continue to do so. It's five weeks away. In the last 14 days our infection rate has been less than one per cent. ""We are confident that it's safe. The risk is minimal to zero. Why shouldn't we start playing. Why are we going to rob our fans and players because of scaremongering and alarmist rhetoric?""

114,/sport/tennis/tennis-australia-on-verge-of-rolling-out-new-domestic-competition-20200424-p54myd.html,Tennis Australia on verge of rolling out new domestic competition,"Tennis Australia is edging closer towards revealing the details of a domestic competition to help the country's leading players keep competing and assist the sport during the coronavirus pandemic by pivoting away from its heavy reliance on international travel. As the AFL and NRL move carefully in putting plans in place to resume their competitions once they given the all-clear from health authorities, Australia’s governing body for tennis also said it “fully expects” to be one of the first of the professional sports to emerge after the pandemic gloom. Replay   In a year of extraordinary upheaval for global sport, the tennis calendar has a vastly different look with the tennis circuit shut down suddenly in early March, Wimbledon cancelled for the first time since the Second World War and the French Open rescheduled for September. With no guarantee of professional tennis resuming overseas any earlier than July, officials are being forced to rejig. Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley said the governing body started thinking about five weeks ago as to what “an optimal domestic competition” could look like as the country’s leading players face the unusual reality of living through a winter in Australia. He said there were joint priorities of helping Australia’s elite players by playing in a strong competition and engaging the sport’s commercial and broadcast partners by building “some content domestically for our players”. “We’re right in the thick of that and we’ll soon be rolling it out,” Tiley told The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. John Millman has advocated for a domestic tennis competition during the sport's shutdown due to coronavirus.Credit:Joe Armao “We’ve got one competition which we’re going to be announcing and rolling out and, who knows, it may become a new normal for us at that time of the year, which could be pretty cool.” Australia’s third-highest-ranked men’s player John Millman was among those advocating for and pushing Tennis Australia to introduce a domestic competition – a state-of-origin type concept involving current and former players – but the path in which Tennis Australia goes down in 2020 remains unclear. ""If Australia recovers before ATP tour is ready to kick off again I think we have a unique opportunity in our sport to create domestic interest in tennis again,"" Millman tweeted this month. ""Instead of having your run of the mill money tournaments imagine something completely different. How about an interstate teams competition?” While Tiley is confident tennis will be among the first of the professional sports to recommence as soon as practicable, he reiterated that they would abide by all government directions. “We have to wait for a lot of those restrictions to be lifted before going with something that we could actually roll out,” Tiley said. “But we’re excited. ""It’s great that John and other players have ideas.” Tiley also said the ease for the sport to abide by social distancing rules worked in its favour. “We’re fortunate that because we’re a sport that you can practice social distance and isolation and still compete, because you’re so far from your opponent,” he said. “You can switch sides of the court by going [a different] side from the net … and be pretty far from your opponent. “We do have that luxury when it comes to the sport of tennis, and we’ll certainly use it.” Despite the shutdown of state borders, Tennis Australia is likely to have the flexibility to take any domestic competition to a range of locations across Australia. “We’ve also got to be mindful we’re going into winter. The courts will have to be covered or have a roof over it,"" Tiley said. “We have parts of Australia, too, that have great winters.""

115,/sport/rugby-union/the-mystery-man-who-could-step-in-to-fill-rugby-s-leadership-void-20200423-p54mk5.html,The mystery man who could step in to fill rugby's leadership void,"Rugby Australia's Mosman connections continue to deliver for the game, with Peter Wiggs one of the leading candidates to fill the governing body's leadership void following the sudden resignation of Raelene Castle. Wiggs, an economics graduate of Sydney University who went on to found private equity fund Archer Capital, has been on the RA board for just three weeks. Yet in that time the former Mosman winger, who counts former Wallabies captain Phil Kearns and Australian Olympic Committee boss Matt Carroll among his associates, appears to have made himself indispensable to the organisation. Peter Wiggs is playing an increasingly pivotal role in the crisis operations of Rugby Australia. Credit:Daniel Munoz Wiggs was the circuit breaker in RA's protracted pay deal negotiations with the players union, replacing former RA director Brett Robinson at the table and quickly working through the flashpoints to clinch an overall 83 per cent reduction in the player wages bill. He also led Thursday night's meeting between RA and the Super Rugby chairmen, at which chief financial officer Simon Rabbitt was expected to open the books to the states for the first time. Wiggs' contribution in a short space of time has many traditionally disparate voices privately singing his praises, from former RA chief executive Raelene Castle to the Super Rugby chairs, the players union and other state administrators. It has also increased speculation he may be one of the key figures called upon to lead the game through the next eight months following Castle's resignation on Thursday night. Her replacement will have to grapple with uncertainty about when the professional game – and the revenue tap – may be able to resume. Fellow director Daniel Herbert also looms as a candidate, with the board expected to appoint an interim chief executive before undertaking a formal search through a recruitment firm later in the year. Kearns and Carroll said Wiggs' business acumen and deep understanding of rugby's value were the reasons he had made a big impact in a short period of time. ""He's a builder of businesses, and a builder of value, he's not a guy who goes in and tears things apart,"" Carroll said. ""He is just what RA needs at this moment – a very smart operator who knows his finances and knows how business needs to be run. He would be a tough negotiator but also a very fair one."" Kearns, another resident of the affluent harbourside suburb along with former director John Eales and former chief executive Bill Pulver, said he had a ruthless streak the game needed. ""I don't know him incredibly well. He was the assistant coach of the team my son played in and I observed that he was committed, there at just about every training session,"" Kearns said. ""You can't be a dummy in the private equity world and succeed. You have to be smart, you have to be a little bit ruthless and you have to be decisive, and that sums up why he was influential in the pay deal with [Rugby Union Players Association]. The deal had to be done quickly so the ability to make a decision and move on to the next one was really important."" Carroll, a former RA deputy CEO under John O'Neill, said he and Wiggs played together at Mosman all through their junior rugby and grade years. ""What I've learnt in sports administration is that you need to also fundamentally care about the game you're in or the sport you're running. Peter cares deeply about the game. He wouldn't be on the board otherwise."" Georgina Robinson is the chief rugby reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald. Copyright © 2020", Georgina Robinson ,"April 23, 2020"

Rock My Wand is having her seventh run in a very busy first preparation but this race looks to have fallen into her lap. Last start the Matthew Smith-trained filly ran home strongly behind Away Game in the group 2 Percy Sykes during The Championships. Punter’s Intelligence shows that she ran the fastest last 600m in the race too, clocking 36.12s to finish alongside See You Soon and Dame Giselle. Has to transfer her wet track form onto a firmer surface but she’s the horse to beat, as the market suggests. 1. Formentera sat outside of the leader and won well at Warwick Farm last start. Should be able to stretch to 1400m and maintains his association with Tim Clark.How to play it: Rock My Wand to win. Newcastle trainer Kris Lees has one eye on the Brisbane carnival with Graff, who tackles Saturday’s Hawkesbury Gold Rush over 1100m at the GardensCredit:AAP Love the way 3. Laure Me In found the line at Warwick Farm last start over the mile having settled last from the wide draw. Punter’s Intelligence shows his 35.77s last-600m split was three lengths faster than the next best while he was the only runner to break 12s the last 200m. When trained by Tony McEvoy the five-year-old won dominantly over 1800m at Flemington (January last year) and Laure Me In looks to be wanting the extra trip now. 4. Shadow Flight overcame being horribly disadvantaged at the weights in the group 3 Neville Sellwood last start to run a bold race and finish a  close-up third to Night’s Watch. The six-year-old is in career best form but jumps up in the ratings  now and is four weeks between runs.How to play it: Laure Me In. 16. Donandkim was trapped wide, shuffled back in the run and blocked in the straight all in the same race last start. That was behind Indy Car and Icebath, the early favourites for the Hawkesbury Guineas. Hoping things are a lot less problematic for the Gerald Ryan-trained three-year-old here. Last preparation, his first for Ryan, he won three from four, with the defeat a game third in the group 3 Spring Stakes at Newcastle behind Asiago. There doesn’t look to be much separating a lot of these horses ability-wise so the map is key and Donandkim should get a lovely run. 5. McCormack was trapped wide in the Provincial Championships Final. Forget that. Had been flying prior and finds Hugh Bowman.How to play it: Donandkim each-way. It’s a far cry from the $20+ we got about 6. Bangkok second and third-up but here we go again with the Allan Denham-trained mare. Drawn barrier 1, expect to see the five-year-old much closer. She isn’t a one-dimensional backmarker. On the five other occasions she has drawn inside she has settled third, second, fifth, seventh and fourth. All three of her runs have been exceptional this time back. First-up she was luckless behind Fasika and I Am Excited before making up a stack of late ground in her last two. This is the last hurrah for two time group1 winner 1. In Her Time. She is also exceptionally well in with 60kg given her lofty benchmark rating. Her runs have been much better than they read on paper.How to play it: Bangkok to win. This appears to be a very targeted preparation with 2. Graff in order to get him winning again ahead of loftier Queensland targets. The four-year-old wouldn’t have been out of place in the group 1 TJ Smith Stakes yet here he is in a listed race with the blinkers going back on having won his most recent Newcastle trial impressively. He has drawn soft and Hugh Bowman rides. Two of Graff’s three wins have been over the Rosehill 1100m. Sure, he carries 59kg but he has the class to overcome that. First-up last preparation he was beaten a length by Redzel and Pierata with Nature Strip and Sunlight back in fourth and fifth. The pattern that has started to emerge with lightning fast mare 15. Agent Pippa is that she responds to being kept fresh. She’ll give a big sight.How to play it: Graff to win. Convinced that 3. Eleven Eleven is the best horse in this race. Just wish he drew a gate. Eleven Eleven’s first up run was a touch hidden with the son of Fastnet Rock running the fastest 600-400 and 400-200 before peaking on his run. The query I’ve got is whether Greg Hickman’s three-year-old is still going to be half a run short, especially straight out to 1400m but last preparation in Queensland highlights how talented he is with three consecutive placings behind Alligator Blood. They were all on good tracks. 4. Bandersnatch smashed the clock first-up last preparation. He’ll roll along in front with the benefit of the inside draw.How to play it: Eleven Eleven. 6. Girl Tuesday didn’t look at all comfortable first up in the wet conditions. Forget she ever ran. Has since been back to the trials with the four weeks between runs and despite running last, love how she trucked through the line. Back on top of the ground, expect her to bounce back in a big way. The five-year-old was outstanding last preparation, bolting in first-up beating Bangkok and Cradle Mountain before finishing alongside Avilius at weight-for-age. This is a lovely race for 16. Live And Free with 53kg on his back but he has always improved sharply second up. However, 1500m first-up and having won a trial recently in the manner of a horse ready to go, perhaps John O’Shea has the five-year-old more forward than in past preparations.How to play it: Girl Tuesday each-way. 13. Nordicus is knocking on the door this time back having savaged the line in two runs. The blueblood gelding (Dundeel x Miss Finland) is now under the care of Anthony Cummings and he has the four-year-old flying. First-up he matched motors with Indy Car over 1100m before staying at 1100m on a heavy track at Warwick Farm. His 35.31s last 600m was the quickest of the entire meeting. That’s despite his earlier form suggesting he wasn’t fond of wet tracks. He jumps into Saturday company here but third up on top of the ground and out to 1300m, he’ll take holding out with any luck from the car park draw. 11. Miss Einstein has won three of her six starts and is a lightly-raced mare worth following.How to play it: Nordicus each-way.

The pair enjoyed 11 group 1 wins together in the 1990s and O’Shea believes Boss has turned the clock back to that sort of form since returning to Sydney last year. Live And Free bursts away to victory last year.Credit:AAP “As a trainer, you watch jockeys closely and he has reminded me of the jockey that was winning on Racing To Win and Private Steer in the past couple of months,” O’Shea said. “When Glen is riding like that, you want him on your team, you need him on your team, particular when you have 53kg in a race like this. “There are not that many jockeys that can ride 53kg and be as good as he is at the moment.” The rejuvenated Boss has put together a raft of big-race wins since returning to Australia from Singapore, including the The Everest, Golden Eagle, Newmarket and a group 1 double on the final day of The Championships in the Australian Oaks and Sydney Cup. He was one of the first calls O’Shea made when he knew Live And Free would get the limit weight in the Hawkesbury Cup. Live And Free has peaked at this time of year for the past two campaigns. It was part of the planning to target the Hawkesbury Cup and Scone Cup. O'Shea made sure he had Boss on the team for an impressive barrier trial win and has Live And Free tuned up for his return. “We have him a bit more forward than we usually have him first-up,” O’Shea said. “He had a little setback when we got him back in work, so we picked these races and worked towards them. “He has shown he is a listed and group 3 class horse in the past, and these are the right races for him to start off in. “You saw in the trial that he is ready to go and if Glen gets him into the right spot he is up to being in the finish.” The only worry for O'Shea is that Boss hasn’t had any luck on Live And Free in two race-day rides in the Villiers Stakes and a listed race in Brisbane. Live And Free went to the line untested because of traffic problems on both occasions. O'Shea is hoping for a change of luck on Saturday “Both times Glen never found a clear run and it would be fair to say that the owners are hoping it is third time lucky and he gets the right sort of run this time,” O’Shea said. “He should be midfield in the run and hopefully get clear in the straight and have the final crack at them.” Live And Free has had support from $9 to $7.50 in the Hawkesbury Cup where Amangiri is the $5.50 BetEasy favourite. ""Amangiri is the one we are all going to be chasing but my bloke is going really well,"" O'Shea said. Racing writer for The Sydney Morning Herald Copyright © 2020", Chris Roots ,"April 24, 2020"
