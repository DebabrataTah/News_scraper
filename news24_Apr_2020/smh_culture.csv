Strike organiser Daisy Jeffrey has something to say on hope.Credit:Louise Kennerley   On HopeDaisy JeffreyHachette, $16.99  Credit:  When Daisy Jeffrey, one of the organisers of the School Strike 4 Climate, was asked to write this essay, it was to be ‘‘On Change’’, which she regarded as ‘‘a hell of a lot easier than ‘On Hope’ ’’. Not surprisingly, given the patronising opposition that the movement is up against, this essay – bursting with the energy and longing of adolescence – swings between hope and despair as Jeffrey struggles to keep up with her school work while taking to the world stage to give voice to young peoples’ fears for the future. In documenting how she became an activist, she demonstrates that the only lasting antidote to the feelings of helplessness that breed despair is working for change. She doesn’t want adults to put their hope in young people, she wants everyone to take responsibility and take action. PICK OF THE WEEKEllis Rowan: A Life in PicturesChristine Morton-EvansNLA Publishing, $34.99  Credit:  If Indiana Jones has an Australian forerunner, it’s got to be Ellis Rowan. The sight of this ‘‘petite, elfin-featured woman, armed with painting gear and parasol, negotiating murky swamps and snake-infested jungles in full Victorian attire’’, says Christine Morton-Evans, ‘‘amazed all who came across her’’. Controversial and undaunted by convention, she pursued her botanical specimens in dangerous locations with the zeal of one seeking the holy grail. She won innumerable medals for her paintings and became a household name both for her work and her embellished reports of her intrepid adventures. Yet she is now largely forgotten. For all the drama and tragedy of her life, her sometimes delicate, sometimes luscious, paintings steal the show in this handsome publication that, a century after her death, restores her work to its rightful place in the public gaze. Valkyrie: The Women of the Viking WorldJohanna Katrin FridriksdottirBloomsbury, $40  Credit:  There’s little evidence that Viking women fought in battle as popular television drama would have it. Yet Norse sagas are full of powerful, ferocious heroines, from the valkyries – supernatural beings who decide who will die in battle – to vengeful, blood-thirsty queens who use their children as political pawns. While historically unreliable, the sagas highlight the ‘‘horrific costs’’ women paid in ‘‘an unyielding culture of honor’’, says Johanna Katrin Fridriksdottir. At the same time, however, Norse laws gave married and widowed women considerable rights and security. The author’s dilemma, in this scholarly study, is to reconcile the larger-than-life legends of monstrous mothers and terrifying shield maidens with the more mundane and complex reality of daily life for Viking women from childhood to old age. The School of RestorationAlice Achan & Philippa TyndaleAllen & Unwin, $32.99  Credit:  ‘‘Why am I still alive,’’ Alice Achan asked herself, ‘‘when almost every person I rose for each morning is gone?’’ Her happy childhood in a village in northern Uganda had been shattered by the Lord’s Resistance Army and she was paralysed by grief. After years of struggling to get an education and a diploma in social work, she still felt overwhelmed by the brutal experiences of girls who had been abducted by rebels. An urgent desire took hold of her to open a school for these survivors of sexual violence. ‘‘In the school of my dreams, girls would be nurtured by their teachers, and learn that they are equal to any other person.’’ Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this against-all-odds story of the academy she founded is Achan’s and her students’ conviction that only forgiveness ‘‘can release us from the bondage of bitterness’’.   PICK OF THE WEEKThe Night WatchmanLouise ErdrichCorsair, $32.99  Credit:  Louise Erdrich was inspired to write The Night Watchman by the experience of her grandfather – a Chippewa man who lived on the Turtle Mountain reservation in North Dakota and who fought, in the 1950s, to stop the US government from dispossessing his people of their land. Thomas Wazhushk is a night watchman galvanised into action that will take him to Washington D.C. to save his community. We also follow his niece Patrice, a factory-worker with an alcoholic father, and sole breadwinner for her family. Patrice leaves the reservation for the first time determined to find her sister Vera, last seen in Minnesota. Although Thomas’ political battle has momentous consequence, what stands out is more intimate: the telling detail, the warmth and compassion Erdrich brings to her portrayal of characters struggling to navigate two worlds. The Night of All SoulsPhilippa SwanVintage, $32.99  Credit:  In lockdown I recently reread Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence. Was there ever a writer so sharp, so acidic in her assessment of society, yet so generous in her imagination of the people trapped within it? In The Night of All Souls, she returns from the grave. Philippa Swan’s erudite homage takes a page from Wharton’s unheralded ghost stories: the author is resurrected in an anteroom to the afterlife, and given a novella about a woman who works at the Wharton museum in Massachusetts. Edith must decide whether to publish or burn the work, revisiting her own writing in the process. It may have the trappings of a ghost story, but the most appealing element of Swan’s novel is its submerged literary appreciation of Wharton’s oeuvre, delivered in tandem with lively elements of biography, and shades of the wit and style for which Wharton was renowned. Gathering EvidenceMartin MacInnesAtlantic, $29.99  Credit:  Abstract, unnerving quasi-detective fiction with traces of absurdist dystopia, Gathering Evidence draws a husband and wife into parallel investigations. It begins with a treatise on a new social media app called Nest, which collates user data and derives a unique pattern from it. Soon, no one can make serious life decisions without consulting their patterns. That menacing prospect hovers as we meet John, a programmer with a large tech company, and his wife Shel, a primatologist. Shel travels to Africa to investigate the death of bonobos in a national park. Plans change and a dangerous situation develops. Meanwhile, John is attacked by an unknown assailant, and wakes up to visits from an anonymous medico; he must piece together his memories to discover what is happening to him and why. MacInnes has created a strangely prescient vision that fuses risks of ecological catastrophe, technological dependence, and social isolation. Hitler’s PeacePhilip KerrHachette, $32.99  Credit:  The late Philip Kerr’s historical detective novels (set in Nazi Germany and featuring Bernie Gunther, a former policeman turned private investigator) were more than entertaining bestsellers. And if fans can’t look forward to further books in the series, there’s still Hitler’s Peace, which offers a twist-riddled and meticulously constructed espionage thriller wrapped in alternate history. It’s autumn, 1943 and Willard Mayer – philosophy professor, lothario and US spy – has been sent to Tehran by Roosevelt for the Allied conference with Churchill and Stalin. Knowing the war cannot be won, Hitler wants peace and only Churchill won’t negotiate. Enter Mayer, whose shadowy career may have involved being a double- and even triple-agent, and the stage is set for a spy novel with very high stakes. Kerr writes with great style and intelligence and departs from history with convincing plausibility. Copyright © 2020"," Fiona Capp , Cameron Woodhead ","April 24, 2020"

While dawn services will continue, they will not be open to the public. Instead, ceremonies will be beamed into living rooms across the country to comply with strict social distancing rules. Anzac Day dawn services and veteran marches will not take place this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen RSLs across Australia have encouraged Australians to ""light up the dawn"" by standing on their driveways or balconies with candles (or the light on their phones) at 6am to commemorate those who have served. People can join a nationwide RSL Facebook event or visit rslnsw.org.au/anzac-spirit/ and listen to the dawn service streamed live while they join the commemorations from home. ABC managing director David Anderson said Anzac Day broadcasts would take on extra significance this year. ""Thousands of Australians who would normally attend their national, state or local remembrance services will not be able to do so,"" he said.

6,/culture/books/why-delay-booker-prize-holds-off-having-a-virtual-presentation-20200421-p54lt9.html,Why delay? Booker Prize holds off having a virtual presentation,"To postpone or not to postpone – that is the question. Awards nights face a tricky conundrum these days. In the past couple of weeks in Australia, the presentation both of the Stella Prize and the Vogel Award have migrated online in the face of COVID-19 restrictions. Disappointing for the winners and the organisers and for those who might have been in attendance in real life. But the virtual presentations were pretty good and did their winners proud. Shokoofeh Azar has to wait longer to see if she has won the International Booker Prize.Credit:  The Vogel ceremony was businesslike and to the point, with Clare Bowditch saying that while it was an opportunity to ""celebrate a young emerging Australian author"" – that is, winner Kate Kruimink (A Treacherous Country) – all writers deserve our support and encouragement at this time. The Stella ceremony was a lengthier affair, with lots of people chipping in and presented by Patricia Karvelas and, as with the Vogel, a pre-recorded acceptance speech from the winner, in this case Jess Hill (See What You Made Me Do). (Something else the winners had in common during the writing of their books was newborns to contend with.) But unlike the Stella and Vogel, the International Booker Prize has decided to delay the May 19 announcement of its £50,000 ($98,000) prize (shared by author and translator) – which is a shame for the Iranian-Australian writer Shokoofeh Azar, whose first novel, The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, is one of six shortlisted titles. But you can't really fault the thinking behind the delay. According to a statement, the award will be delayed until later in the northern summer to ensure that readers are able to get hold of copies of the shortlisted books. ""Access to the books at present is problematic. In discussions with the Booker Prize Foundation, publishers have stressed how severely book distribution is disrupted due to COVID-19, so steps are being taken to ensure that the authors, translators, publishers and book trade are best supported at this difficult time."" As Gaby Wood, the literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation said: ""We've decided on this course of action to ensure that the shortlist, and ultimately the winner, can be celebrated at a time when readership of these exceptional novels is made easier for everyone."" So the best thing we can all do is buy copies of the books by Kruimink, Hill and Azar. And remember, most bookshops are taking orders online so there's no excuse.

7,/culture/books/why-delay-booker-prize-holds-off-having-a-virtual-presentation-20200421-p54lt9.html,Why delay? Booker Prize holds off having a virtual presentation,"To postpone or not to postpone – that is the question. Awards nights face a tricky conundrum these days. In the past couple of weeks in Australia, the presentation both of the Stella Prize and the Vogel Award have migrated online in the face of COVID-19 restrictions. Disappointing for the winners and the organisers and for those who might have been in attendance in real life. But the virtual presentations were pretty good and did their winners proud. Shokoofeh Azar has to wait longer to see if she has won the International Booker Prize.Credit:  The Vogel ceremony was businesslike and to the point, with Clare Bowditch saying that while it was an opportunity to ""celebrate a young emerging Australian author"" – that is, winner Kate Kruimink (A Treacherous Country) – all writers deserve our support and encouragement at this time. The Stella ceremony was a lengthier affair, with lots of people chipping in and presented by Patricia Karvelas and, as with the Vogel, a pre-recorded acceptance speech from the winner, in this case Jess Hill (See What You Made Me Do). (Something else the winners had in common during the writing of their books was newborns to contend with.) But unlike the Stella and Vogel, the International Booker Prize has decided to delay the May 19 announcement of its £50,000 ($98,000) prize (shared by author and translator) – which is a shame for the Iranian-Australian writer Shokoofeh Azar, whose first novel, The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, is one of six shortlisted titles. But you can't really fault the thinking behind the delay. According to a statement, the award will be delayed until later in the northern summer to ensure that readers are able to get hold of copies of the shortlisted books. ""Access to the books at present is problematic. In discussions with the Booker Prize Foundation, publishers have stressed how severely book distribution is disrupted due to COVID-19, so steps are being taken to ensure that the authors, translators, publishers and book trade are best supported at this difficult time."" As Gaby Wood, the literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation said: ""We've decided on this course of action to ensure that the shortlist, and ultimately the winner, can be celebrated at a time when readership of these exceptional novels is made easier for everyone."" So the best thing we can all do is buy copies of the books by Kruimink, Hill and Azar. And remember, most bookshops are taking orders online so there's no excuse.

And the 2008 global financial crisis was a particularly powerful spur to creativity, tossing up insights that have plenty to say about the fix we’re in today. A host of films examined the crisis from an assortment of angles and all of them vividly evoke the wonder, as well as the fear, that people feel when society’s institutions fail them. No one can quite comprehend the speed with which their lives are changing or get a grip on the cause. Christian Bale plays an eccentric financial wiz in The Big Short.
 Sometimes the filmmakers become a little too excited, gussying up the complexities and double talk of the financial world with the overworked trappings of a suspense movie, but the best prove to be pretty skilled at translating exposition into drama without having to dress up – or dress down – the facts by simplifying them to the point of distortion. American business writer Michael Lewis is a master of the genre and his adaptation of his 2010 non-fiction book The Big Short (2015) is the most popular of the films made about the GFC. But it’s also one of the most hyperactive, packed with cinematic tricks more dizzying than the convolutions of the stockmarket itself. More elegant is J.C. Chandor’s Margin Call (2011), which takes you inside the corporate boiler room to demonstrate the mechanics of the meltdown as a Manhattan merchant bank, sounding very like Lehman Brothers, tries to save itself from collapse. Chandor, the son of a Merrill Lynch banker, writes as if he’s been imbibing the language and customs of the banking system since birth. His dialogue is digestible as well as piquant and a cast headed by Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey and Stanley Tucci relish every word. Mixed with the ambient smell of fear is an acrid whiff of irony. And at the nub of it all is a wonderfully misanthropic speech delivered by Paul Bettany as the personable cynic who runs the trading desk. Carping at what he calls the hypocrisies of ""normal people"", he says they may tell themselves that they want the world to be a fairer place but they’re unwilling to help make it happen because it’s going to cost them. The corporate consultant played by George Clooney in Jason Reitman’s Up in the Air (2009) is a little further down the food chain than Margin Call’s investment bankers but he, too, is adept at the dark art of ""letting people go"". He does it for a living – employed by a company retained by businesses that lack the courage to do it themselves. Their reluctance goes beyond squeamishness. They’re afraid of the legal tangle that awaits them should they mess up the semantics. George Clooney and Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air.  It’s a deftly done film. Reitman encourages you to get to like Clooney’s self-centred charmer, who eases his way through life, hoping that none of the dirt will stick, right up to the nasty shock he receives at the film’s end. An antidote to all of this unabashed self-interest can be found in Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake (2016), a sardonic yet heartening story about a 59-year-old Newcastle carpenter unlucky enough to have a heart attack at work. Britain’s bureaucracy turns out to be singularly ill-suited to the task of providing him with the sickness benefits to which he’s entitled but he refuses to give up. Played by Dave Johns, a stand-up comic and occasional actor, he’s sustained by a healthy curiosity and the grace to be mordantly amused by a system designed to make ciphers out of those who depend on it and those who administer it. It’s a thought that will resonate with anyone who has ever waited in a Centrelink queue. Hayley Squires and Dave Johns in I, Daniel Blake. Told from a similar perspective is Ramin Bahrani’s 99 Homes (2014), which is about the fear of homelessness that haunts so many people during an economic crisis. Andrew Garfield’s Dennis Nash, an unemployed building worker, is one of them. Forced to move his family into a cheap motel after falling behind with the mortgage payments, he’s close to despair when Mephistopheles comes along. Michael Shannon’s Richard Carver, the developer who evicted him, offers him a job fitting out the houses that he’s been buying cheap from the banks. Dennis accepts and, a little implausibly, he quickly moves up in Carver’s organisation to become the one who knocks on the doors of the dispossessed to tell them they have to get out. The film’s most telling speech comes from Carver as he formulates his explanation for the way the system works in favour of his kind of predator. As he sees it, America is a country built by winners for winners and he’s just taking advantage of the facilities. For an overview of the causes of the GFC, the film to watch is Charles Ferguson’s 2010 Oscar-winning documentary, Inside Job. Its analysis of collateralised debt obligations and the other exotic financial instruments that helped bring about the crisis may not be pertinent to what’s happening today but there is much to be learnt from its clear and comprehensive rundown on the nexus between America’s political, corporate and academic establishments as it existed at the time. It was this nexus, Ferguson suggests, that helped to dismantle the restrictions stopping banks from taking the risks that led to the meltdown. Taken together, the five American films do a lot to explain the rise of Donald Trump. The Big Short, Margin Call and Inside Job examine the sense of callous complacency that precipitated the crash and Up in the Air and 99 Homes look at the carnage it created and the dispiritedness it left in its wake. Washington and Wall Street had been tested and found wanting. And America was still suffering the hangover when Trump, the disrupter, came along to exploit those frustrations and create a whole lot more.

14,/culture/movies/a-250-year-symphony-the-many-movie-angles-on-beethoven-20200408-p54iao.html,A 250-year symphony: The many movie angles on Beethoven,"The biopic may have a reputation for stodginess but it’s actually one of the most malleable of storytelling instruments. If you don’t believe it, take a look at Ludwig van Beethoven’s long and colourful history on screen. We’ve had Beethoven as romantic hero, political animal, irascible old man and, finally and most fancifully, Beethoven the late-blooming feminist.  Gary Oldman as Beethoven in the 1994 movie Immortal Beloved.Credit:Keith Hamshere/Getty Images As we celebrate his 250th birthday, let’s start with Immortal Beloved (1994), a headlong tour of Beethoven’s love life by British writer Bernard Rose, with Gary Oldman at his brooding best. Rose really took a gamble with this one, tackling the most persistent mystery in Beethoven’s life – the identity of the woman whom he addressed as “immortal beloved” in a letter found among his papers after his death. Rose nominated a complete outsider for the title, an interpretation which necessitated a comprehensive rearrangement of one of the key episodes in the composer’s personal life. Beethoven scholars were not impressed but the film can’t be dismissed. It plays as if directed in a state of delirium with Georg Solti and the London Symphony Orchestra pumping up the emotional levels and enhancing Oldman’s performance to such effect that fans and critics alike have chosen to forgive the improbabilities and surrender to the mood. Fritz Kortner in the 1927 silent movie Das Leben des Beethoven.Credit:Ullstein Bild/Getty Rose was not the first filmmaker to take on the “immortal beloved” question. It was Austrian silent film director Hans Otto who first explored Beethoven’s perpetually troubled love life on screen in his 1927 silent movie Das Leben des Beethoven, starring Fritz Kortner. In 1936, French master Abel Gance directed Un Grand Amour de Beethoven, which strips down the composer’s many amours to a single irregular triangle formed by his desire for his student, Julie Guicciardi, his long relationship with the steadfast Hungarian noblewoman, Therese von Brunsvik, and his overriding passion for composition. In this version, it’s the music, rather than the man, which provides the allure, since Gance’s casting flouts all the usual standards of movie glamour. As his Beethoven, he chose the French stage actor Harry Baur, a hulking figure with many chins and a sincerely doomstruck expression. No one could ever have accused him of being an irrepressible lover but he was skilled in the art of the subtle adjustment and, decades on, his close-ups retain their poignancy. Radically deviating from fact, Gance has him marry Therese but yearn after Julie, to whom he awards the “immortal beloved” title. A more realistic – and typically British – approach is at work in director Simon Cellan Jones’ BBC TV movie Eroica (2003). It focuses on a single episode: the first performance of Beethoven’s Third Symphony in Vienna before his patron, Prince Lobkowitz (Jack Davenport), and a small group of his fellow aristocrats. The Napoleonic wars are the topic de jour, Beethoven is still a Bonaparte admirer (that was soon to change) and a verbal skirmish breaks out in the Prince’s drawing room. A supercilious Tim Piggott-Smith, cast as an Austrian count, is patronising Beethoven (Ian Hart) in an attempt to learn where he fits in the prevailing class system.

But in standing up to him, she does change his mind about what women can and can’t do. And the relationship does persuade – right up to the climactic scene in which Beethoven, now completely deaf, conducts the Ninth for the first time with Anna giving him his cues from a seat among the musicians. There have been other features, documentaries and TV series. In the early 1960s, the composer landed in Disneyland as the hero of a two-part special starring Karlheinz Bohm, son of the conductor Karl Boehm. Ironically, given the vanilla-flavoured nature of the exercise, Bohm became much more famous seven years later as the perverted lead character in British director Michael Powell’s cultish thriller Peeping Tom. Then came the bicentennial year when Beethoven became entangled in post-modernism via Ludwig Van, a puckish offering by German-based Argentinian composer Mauricio Kagel. A confection of parody, burlesque and satire aimed at the packaging and mass-marketing of art, it was not a popular success. All of these films have helped to illuminate aspects of Beethoven’s art, life and personality.

15,/culture/movies/a-250-year-symphony-the-many-movie-angles-on-beethoven-20200408-p54iao.html,A 250-year symphony: The many movie angles on Beethoven,"The biopic may have a reputation for stodginess but it’s actually one of the most malleable of storytelling instruments. If you don’t believe it, take a look at Ludwig van Beethoven’s long and colourful history on screen. We’ve had Beethoven as romantic hero, political animal, irascible old man and, finally and most fancifully, Beethoven the late-blooming feminist.  Gary Oldman as Beethoven in the 1994 movie Immortal Beloved.Credit:Keith Hamshere/Getty Images As we celebrate his 250th birthday, let’s start with Immortal Beloved (1994), a headlong tour of Beethoven’s love life by British writer Bernard Rose, with Gary Oldman at his brooding best. Rose really took a gamble with this one, tackling the most persistent mystery in Beethoven’s life – the identity of the woman whom he addressed as “immortal beloved” in a letter found among his papers after his death. Rose nominated a complete outsider for the title, an interpretation which necessitated a comprehensive rearrangement of one of the key episodes in the composer’s personal life. Beethoven scholars were not impressed but the film can’t be dismissed. It plays as if directed in a state of delirium with Georg Solti and the London Symphony Orchestra pumping up the emotional levels and enhancing Oldman’s performance to such effect that fans and critics alike have chosen to forgive the improbabilities and surrender to the mood. Fritz Kortner in the 1927 silent movie Das Leben des Beethoven.Credit:Ullstein Bild/Getty Rose was not the first filmmaker to take on the “immortal beloved” question. It was Austrian silent film director Hans Otto who first explored Beethoven’s perpetually troubled love life on screen in his 1927 silent movie Das Leben des Beethoven, starring Fritz Kortner. In 1936, French master Abel Gance directed Un Grand Amour de Beethoven, which strips down the composer’s many amours to a single irregular triangle formed by his desire for his student, Julie Guicciardi, his long relationship with the steadfast Hungarian noblewoman, Therese von Brunsvik, and his overriding passion for composition. In this version, it’s the music, rather than the man, which provides the allure, since Gance’s casting flouts all the usual standards of movie glamour. As his Beethoven, he chose the French stage actor Harry Baur, a hulking figure with many chins and a sincerely doomstruck expression. No one could ever have accused him of being an irrepressible lover but he was skilled in the art of the subtle adjustment and, decades on, his close-ups retain their poignancy. Radically deviating from fact, Gance has him marry Therese but yearn after Julie, to whom he awards the “immortal beloved” title. A more realistic – and typically British – approach is at work in director Simon Cellan Jones’ BBC TV movie Eroica (2003). It focuses on a single episode: the first performance of Beethoven’s Third Symphony in Vienna before his patron, Prince Lobkowitz (Jack Davenport), and a small group of his fellow aristocrats. The Napoleonic wars are the topic de jour, Beethoven is still a Bonaparte admirer (that was soon to change) and a verbal skirmish breaks out in the Prince’s drawing room. A supercilious Tim Piggott-Smith, cast as an Austrian count, is patronising Beethoven (Ian Hart) in an attempt to learn where he fits in the prevailing class system.

Author Christos Tsiolkas, filmmaker Jocelyn Moorhouse and Offspring creator Debra Oswald are among those who have supported calls by former News Limited and Foxtel chief Kim Williams, who is now head of the Copyright Agency, for a 40 per cent funding increase for the Australia Council and Screen Australia, and a doubling of funding for writers. Jocelyn Moorhouse, director of movies including Proof and The Dressmaker, says she would not have had a career without government support of the arts.Credit:Nick Moir ""The most important thing about the arts is that they tell stories about ourselves to ourselves, and that art can ask questions, art can move, art can confront and art can offer solace,"" says Christos Tsiolkas, author of The Slap and Barracuda. ""I doubt there is a person in Australia who isn't experiencing that aspect of the arts at this very moment, even if they're not necessarily aware of it. It might be a book they are reading, a CD or a YouTube video they are watching, it might be watching Home & Away or MasterChef or Mystery Road on TV or streaming."" Filmmaker Jocelyn Moorhouse says that ""being able to see yourself up there, recognising yourself"" on screen is important to our sense of cultural identity. But because of the size of the Australian market, making quality content primarily for local audiences is simply not possible without government support. ""I've benefited my entire career from government funding,"" says Moorhouse. ""My first feature film, Proof, was fully funded by Film Victoria and the Film Finance Corporation [the precursor to Screen Australia]. The Dressmaker had a lot of Screen Australia and Film Victoria money in it. So many people's favourites – Nicole Kidman, Heath Ledger, Hugh Jackman – all started in little Aussie productions that wouldn't have happened without government support."" Shane Brennan, president of the Australian Writers' Guild, has plied much of his career in Hollywood, where he created the series NCIS: Los Angeles. But he, too, benefited from government support early in his career, and believes ""now is not the time to turn your back on this industry because of the economic downturn. ""Government support is critical, it always has been,"" he says. ""The reality is if the government were to reduce or stop funding, we won't have an industry."" They and others were responding to Williams' call for an urgent boost in federal government support for the arts in Australia, to ensure their survival in the face of a sector-wide collapse that he says is ""without precedent"". In an opinion piece published in The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday, Mr Williams wrote ""we are facing a genuine emergency in the framework for the production of Australian content"", driven by the collapse of business models for film, television and the performing arts, exacerbated by ""persistent government underfunding of the arts generally"", and brought to a head by the coronavirus crisis. The call comes a week after the federal government granted the commercial TV networks an exemption from their obligations to broadcast prescribed amounts of first-release Australian drama, children's content and documentaries for the rest of this year, with the possibility of an extension into 2021. It also follows the release of a long-awaited Options Paper outlining four possible models for the future of film and television in Australia, ranging from no change to complete deregulation, and a raft of funding cuts announced by the Australia Council. Novelist Debra Oswald, the creator of Offspring, says backing the Australian culture industries is not just about supporting jobs. ""It's also about the value of what this sector provides to the whole population,"" she says. ""If we as a country want to have our own storytelling we need to have frameworks to make sure that happens."" Enormously popular though it was, there's a fair chance that without quota obligations Offspring might not have been made.Credit:Ten Without quotas, she says, there's a chance Offspring might never have been made because creating local drama is inevitably more expensive than importing stories. ""It makes no sense for the networks to invest in it unless they're required to by the law,"" Ms Oswald says. ""It's the same with the streamers. But culture is not like socks or building materials. If it goes offshore it's a massive loss to the soul of the country."" While there is widespread agreement on the need for government support of the arts in this country, there is also consensus that the system needs to adapt to new realities. ""The industry worldwide has changed dramatically in the past 10 years with the rise of streamers and the effects on broadcast television and the demise of local theatrical releases,"" says Liz Watts, producer of Animal Kingdom, The King and True History of the Kelly Gang. ""But the government has stuck by old systematic thinking. ""The creative industries are worth a great deal as both economic and cultural sectors of the country. There is a clear economic case for the continuation of funding in the screen sector,"" she says.

As with many unexpected wonders in life, its main benefit is the one you’re not expecting: not the possibility of acquiring more things, but the chance to end up with less. In this time of corona-fuelled home-office creation, I’ve given away three rickety Ikea bookshelves, assorted pieces of white melamine, and a brand-new curtain rail that doesn’t fit a single window in our house.

Freecycle allows you to get rid of things without being crushed by landfill guilt. You post your object, field responses, and arrange for pick up: done. It’s different from Gumtree or eBay because there’s no haggling or bidding, and it’s a bit like a charity shop because it works via donation. But you can Freecycle things that no charity shop would ever accept: a “bag full of bubble wrap (assorted sizes)”; “two packs of puppy training pads”; a “section of drain” (I kid you not). You might think no one would ever want such things, but the site is beautiful proof that there’s no accounting for human need – or human taste. Despite the many sensible fridges and couches, Freecycle’s real charm is that of a car boot sale: my trash, your treasure.

ABC boss David Anderson says the Anzac Day broadcasts will be especially significant this year due to social-distancing rules.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The ABCThe ABC's Anzac Day coverage will kick off at 5am AEST. Anzac Stories, presented by Dan Bourchier, will examine the personal lives of Australia's servicemen and women – including those who recently assisted bushfire-stricken communities. The ABC will then broadcast the National Commemorative Service from Canberra's Australian War Memorial. The service begins at 5.30am and will be streamed live on ABC TV, iView and the broadcaster's Facebook and YouTube channels. The event will also be broadcast live on Radio National and ABC local radio. The Ode, The Last Post and a minute of silence will be broadcast at 6am followed by local Anzac Day services. Another minute of silence will air at 11.30am to mark the approximate time when the first Australian troops landed on Gallipoli. Coverage will continue on the ABC's main TV channel throughout the afternoon with a broadcast of the 2015 Gallipoli centenary ceremony at 12.30pm. This will be followed by the Villers-Bretonneux Centenary Commemorative Ceremony (from 2018) at 1.30pm. The ABC will wrap its special coverage at 6.55pm with an Anzac Day address by Governor-General David Hurley. Seven NetworkSeven's coverage begins at 4.30am with an extended edition of Weekend Sunrise, hosted by Monique Wright and Matt Doran. Dawn services will also be broadcast live.

Seven will also air a lone bugler playing The Last Post to an empty Melbourne Cricket Ground. The 6pm news bulletins will have a full wrap of commemorations, followed at 7pm by a special Anzac Day edition of The Latest with Michael Usher and Melissa Doyle. Nine*Like Seven, Nine's coverage will include live broadcasts of early-morning dawn services. In Melbourne the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, will be shown laying a wreath on behalf of all Victorians. Coverage will continue via news bulletins throughout the day. Network 10Network 10 is commemorating Anzac Day with a special episode of Studio 10 hosted by Sarah Harris and Hugh Riminton. The broadcast will start at 5.25am with the Australian War Memorial's dawn service.

And at one level you’d be right: the former is about a young woman in a Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in more or less the present day; the latter is about a Scottish soccer player in the north of England in the early 1880s. But both are about escaping dire, life-limiting circumstances. What could be more of the moment than that? Unorthodox is based on the memoir of Deborah Feldman, who broke free of her Satmar community a decade ago (they practise a branch of Orthodox Judaism whose roots lie in the 18th century observances of a single Hungarian village). Israeli actress Shira Haas is superb as Esther Shapiro in Unorthodox.Credit:Netflix      In real life Feldman edged away, by attending college, by changing the way she dressed, by slowly engaging with the outside world and coming to realise that is where she belonged. In the series, Esther Shapiro (Shira Haas) flees, in a dramatic and daring escape, to Berlin. She goes there because that’s where her mother - also an escapee - lives, but there’s a fierce irony in the choice: the relentless focus on procreation in her faith stems from the belief that Jews have a moral obligation to repopulate because of the Holocaust. Israeli actress Haas is superb. She is 24 (Esty is 19), and tiny; she appears both childlike and fierce as she tries to find a way to protect her core self in the religious world, and grapples with what is true and untrue, safe and unsafe, in the world outside. There are echoes of The Handmaid’s Tale in all this, though the Hasidim are never quite as vile as the monsters of Gilead. Both are essentially about the oppressiveness of a system in which a woman’s only value is conferred by her ability to bear children, and the determination of our heroine to escape it. In The English Game, it’s grinding poverty rather than religion that Fergus Suter (Kevin Guthrie) is trying to escape. His cause is just, but at times he’s not so easy to root for. His upbringing has made him taciturn, emotionally distant, so fixated on rescuing his mother and sisters from his abusive alcoholic father in Glasgow that it comes across as utterly selfish. Not a great trait in a team sport. Suter’s great gift is his mastery of “the passing game”, an advance on the style of soccer codified by the Football Association in London, a body comprising members of the old boys clubs from various public schools - Eton, Rugby, Harrow and the like. Suter is recruited to play for a Lancashire mill team, and paid handsomely for his services. But professionalism is against the rules, a fact that favours the wealthy leisured class over the unleisured working poor. More of that please: The English Game is not as much about soccer as it pretends.Credit:Netflix Created by Downton Abbey’s Julian Fellowes with Oliver Cotton and Tony Charles, this too has its roots in facts. Fergus Suter is regarded as the first professional player in the history of the game. The northern industrial-backed teams were indeed engaged in a struggle for the direction of a game that the private school boys down south regarded as their own. Still, there’s plenty of fudging of the facts too, which is always an issue with historical drama (if you’re telling a story about what happened, why mess with the core details?) But that’s not the biggest failing of The English Game. Nor is the fact some of the relationship drama feels rather wooden and perfunctory. The biggest issue is that there’s not enough of, well, the English game. Just beneath the surface of this somewhat formulaic variation on the Upstairs/Downstairs theme there’s another tale, about how soccer went from medieval pack-running pseudo-thuggery to the beautiful game it is today. Granted, I might belong to a small club on this matter, but that’s the escape story I’d really like to see. Karl Quinn is a senior culture writer at The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

But this Anzac Day will be like no other, and instead the group will watch themselves perform on television from their own isolated locations. Australian band The Rubens with lead singer Sam Margin on the right.Credit:Chris Lane Earlier this week, the band recorded a performance that will be broadcast as part of Saturday's Music From The Home Front concert, to pay respects to the Anzacs and recognise the work of frontline health care workers in Australia. It was the first time the band members had all been in the same place for two months. ""I honestly can't really think back to a time when we haven't seen each other for this long,"" lead singer Sam Margin said. ""We had been recording up to the point we all had to go into isolation, so it's good to have this reason to get back into the studio, at a safe 1.5-metre distance, to record this."" The launch of what was to be their fourth studio album is now on hold, but they did release a single from the recording sessions to satiate fans' appetite for new music. The track Heavy Weather was released on Tuesday and Margin said it was strange not being together to celebrate. ""Just not seeing the band members is hard, we are used to spending so much time on the road together. I would say most of the time when we are releasing something, on release day we are touring somewhere and we will watch how it is doing together,"" he said. ""The group chat is going off, basically."" With the album release on hold and their biggest-ever national tour postponed, Margin and his band mates would be justified in feeling miffed by the situation. But he is surprisingly pragmatic about it. ""Because everyone is going through something at the same time I don't feel so disappointed,"" he said. The Rubens are joined on the concert line-up by a star-studded list of Australian musicians including Archie Roach, Courtney Barnett, Dean Lewis, Delta Goodrem, Emma Donovan, G Flip, James Morrison, Bliss N Eso, Lee Kernaghan, Marlon Williams, Kevin Parker of Tame Impala, Vance Joy and others. The event is the brainchild of music promoter Michael Gudinski and Cold Chisel frontman Jimmy Barnes, who promises two very special performances on the night. Jimmy Barnes has been learning the bagpipes in lockdown. ""Ian Moss and myself are going to do a song together, with my son in Brisbane, my daughter in the [NSW Southern] Highlands, I'm in another part of the Highlands and Mossy is in Sydney, and we are going to do When the War Is Over,"" Barnes said. Later he will be joined by his brother-in-law Mark ""Diesel"" Lizotte for a darker, pared-back version of Barnes' 1985 hit Working Class Man. ""Anzac Day is going to be a very unusual time, I think it is the first time since the war that we haven't been able to go out and march,"" Barnes says. ""I think it is important that we pay our respect to the Anzacs, show support to the armed forces and show support for everybody at home. ""It's not the same as being in a war but we are fighting a hidden enemy here with this virus."" Barnes has been giving people a taste of what they are likely to see in the concert via regular live performances on Instagram with his wife Jane, including a recent video which demonstrated his new-found prowess on the bagpipes. ""We are having a great time,"" he said. ""We are loving just being in our home, getting to play a bit of music and learn things we don't normally get time to do because I am constantly touring or travelling.""

For Neilson, whose website offers merchandise including a beehive brooch, totes and tea towels proclaiming ‘‘the higher the hair, the nearer to God’’, the beehive is about more than just a retro look, as she discovered after she chopped her tortured hair to shoulder-length a few years ago. “When you perform it gives you this persona and it’s like my mojo is wrapped up in that beehive and I really missed having it,” she says. So for the cover of her latest album, Chickaboom, she commissioned a towering creation from a US drag artist and wigmaker for reality show RuPaul’s Drag Race. ''It’s like my mojo is wrapped up in that beehive,'' says Tami Neilson.Credit: Sabin Holloway On stage Neilson is a dynamo – not just the big hair, but the powerhouse voice, the heels, generous curves in sparkly frocks, songs with names such as Stay Outta My Business, A Woman’s Pain and Ten Tonne Truck. Rolling Stone called her ‘‘a firebreathing R & B belter on her own terms’’ and her shows are electric, but also fun. When the coronavirus hit, she was forced to cancel a world tour to promote the album, but she has now come up with a virtual solution of sorts. From this week, her YouTube channel will stream a weekly 15-20 minute show featuring long-distance musical collaborations and previously unreleased live footage. The episodes will include a watch party and live chat with fans. ‘‘I wanted to create something special for my fans, for us to stay connected during this time and hopefully inject a bit of joy and distraction into their day,’’ she says. ‘‘Living out in the country with a really wonky wifi connection, livestreams aren’t a particularly good quality option for me, not to mention that I have two little boys underfoot at all times (shout out to the parents working from home!), so, I wanted to make something a little different to share with my online community of fans.’’ Towering talent ... and hair: Tami Neilson performs at WOMADelaide in March.Credit:Getty Images Musically, Neilson is hard to pigeonhole – country, yes, but also soul, gospel and rockabilly. ‘‘They spring from the same love, the foundations of music in the southern states,’’ she says. Her previous album, Sassafras!, had a big, brash sound with saxophone and strings. Chickaboom, co-produced with Kiwi Delaney Davidson and influenced by his blues sound, is grittier. American Songwriter called it “arguably her finest, most explosive release” and Neilson a “larger-than-life rocking diva”. Neilson was country music royalty before she fell for a Kiwi cop and moved to Auckland in 2007. The Neilson Family Band – Tami, her parents and two brothers – formed in the late 1990s, after her parents sold their home in Canada and took the kids on the road in a motorhome. Tami spent her teenage years touring North America. The family opened for Johnny Cash and Loretta Lynn, were regulars on the General Jackson showboat in the Opryland theme park, and had a top 20 hit with Windows to the Past. Moving to New Zealand was not on the bucket list. “I had so many people saying, ‘you’re committing career suicide’,’’ she recalls. “My publisher at the time said, ‘you know that the people who live there, they come here to make it’.” In New Zealand, she started from scratch. Small gigs, open mic nights – whatever it took to make things work. “I think love is the number-one driving force in our lives, so it was not something that I resented or begrudged but it was a challenge,” she says. Gradually she got a foot in the door and by 2009 began scooping up music awards in New Zealand. Her 2014 album Dynamite!, recorded while she was six months pregnant, was a breakthrough and the awards kept coming, including a string of gongs at the New Zealand Music Awards and APRA’s Silver Scroll for excellence in songwriting in 2014. “Kiwis said New Zealand does not have a country music scene. But I kind of had to make this decision to flip the negatives into positives so I go OK, there is no country music scene here, OK there will be less competition. I will be different. I opened for Emmylou Harris, James Taylor. I thought, if I was in North America I would not get a look-in but because I am in New Zealand these are the opportunities.” Juggling a music career with sons Charlie, 8, and five-year-old Sam has been tricky. Her husband, a police inspector, does school drop-off, his mum helps out and when Neilson tours someone picks up the boys and makes their dinner. It sounds straightforward, but Neilson has faced flak for touring while her kids are young. People say how lucky she is her husband is so involved, but, she asks, why shouldn’t he be? “I had to realise that everybody is entitled to a career and if you really believe in equality I should not be apologising for the fact that my husband and I parent our kids equally.” That commitment to equality has given pause for thought over her “girlie, sparkly” image. “Me in my sequins and beehive and my rockabilly and what people describe as ‘fun’ music, I can look at that and go, ‘what am I doing to make a difference?’.'' But her music is disarming and accessible. “Yes my music is fun and tongue-in-cheek and retro and candy-coloured, but when you get past the wrapping my message is, I feel, just as important. I am singing about equality for women, I am singing about my life, what it is like to be treated as a minority in the music business,'' she says. “I have always had a really clear purpose in my mind. It may be wrapped up in packaging with sparkles and glitter but at the heart of it is a heart for women and for equality and for my children, where the women in their lives will be treated equally.” The TAMI Show screens on Thursdays at 6pm. www.youtube.com/tamineilsondotcom Copyright © 2020", Sue Green ,"April 24, 2020"

But her music is disarming and accessible. “Yes my music is fun and tongue-in-cheek and retro and candy-coloured, but when you get past the wrapping my message is, I feel, just as important. I am singing about equality for women, I am singing about my life, what it is like to be treated as a minority in the music business,'' she says. “I have always had a really clear purpose in my mind. It may be wrapped up in packaging with sparkles and glitter but at the heart of it is a heart for women and for equality and for my children, where the women in their lives will be treated equally.” The TAMI Show screens on Thursdays at 6pm. www.youtube.com/tamineilsondotcom Copyright © 2020", Sue Green ,"April 24, 2020"

From her 1994 album Bright Red, this ballad was written at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but the sailors she sang of might well be us today, marooned on the islands that are our homes. The poetic Anderson painted a distinct image, with a ‘‘hot wind’’ blowing across the oceans and into every port: ‘‘A plague. A black plague. There’s danger everywhere. And you’ve been sailing.’’ Laurie Anderson on stage in 1995, the year after Bright Red was released.Credit:Getty Images Of all the arts, music’s power to instantly conjure an emotional response is hard to quantify – in this instance, a distinct tingle of fear is generated. Anderson’s haunting voice brings into full relief the connections between physical intimacy and the spread of disease. From one person to another, desire and need become a dangerous game; sex and death collide. Through various periods of human crisis, music tends to emerge with a range of agendas – as a balm, a social binder, a political protest, propaganda, simple entertainment, and sometimes as an historical marker. In recent weeks, there has been more than a flurry of posts online about music for the age of COVID-19 – from symphony orchestras collaborating online, to top-10 suggestions of music to listen to in isolation, to music (usually maudlin) that was produced in such circumstances (oh, lonely tormented songwriter!). And of course, the inevitable parodies have erupted: Tim Minchin and Briggs have produced the hilarious lockdown song HouseFyre, satirising Scott Morrison’s leadership during the crisis, while instant YouTube success has visited people stuck at home doing their own COVID-infused versions of classic songs such as Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody (retitled Coronovirus Rhapsody), to Daoi Freyr’s Think About Things. Music also had a therapeutic role during the Black Death, which lasted several centuries. University of York musicologist Christopher Macklin has studied the period in depth and writes that, while plague might evoke images of fear, isolation and the stifling of natural commerce, the music of the day reveals an alternative world: making it involved social exchange and a ‘‘communal solidarity in the face of the universal threat’’. Macklin also writes of how, during Henry the VIII’s reign, fear of the plague caused the infamous king to dismiss his entire court – except for a handful including his physician and the Italian composer and organist Dionisio Memo. ‘‘Given that Memo is not known for anything besides his musical ability, we must conclude that he was retained in this capacity,’’ Macklin writes. ‘‘In other words, during a plague epidemic so deadly that the English court was dissolved, the only people the reigning monarch felt he could not do without were his three most trusted courtiers, his doctor, and ... his composer.’’ In his book Plague and Music in the Renaissance, Remi Chiu also spells out how music-making was a resourceful strategy used for surviving plague. Music, he says, was an ‘‘urgent and active curative’’ animated by changing knowledge of pestilence, and it reflected not a defeatist or reactionary psychology but ‘‘a practical resilience on the part of Renaissance Europeans’’. Its comforts, he asserts, helped give people meaning. This was true centuries later during the worst HIV/AIDS years, in the 1980s-90s. In many African countries, severely debilitated by the HIV crisis, music was often used as a form of education and community connection. Writing in The Culture of AIDS in Africa: Hope and Healing through Music, Vanderbilt University’s Gregory Bartz explores the way in which Uganda managed consistent declines in overall infection rates using music as a critical element. HIV-positive woman Florence Kumunhyu sings about AIDS as part of an educational program in Uganda in 2001. Credit:Getty Images ‘‘Singing and dancing have been among the earliest interventions directed at HIV in the country,’’ he writes. ‘‘In both songs and dramas, Ugandans educate, care for and console one another through music, as they have done for decades.’’ That music was probably better than a lot of what we had to endure in the West – such as the earnest 1985 fundraiser song That’s What Friends Are For. Many will remember a less cheesy fundraiser album, Red, Hot + Blue, from 1990, which featured Neneh Cherry’s rap reworking of the song I’ve Got You Under My Skin (with a memorable video clip by Jean-Baptiste Mondino). It seemed, then, that every artist had to do an obligatory death song that echoed the times – from James Taylor (Never Die Young, 1988) and Elton John (The Last Song, 1992) to Madonna (In This Life, 1992) or Patti Smith (Death Singing, 1997). Writing in the book Sounding Off: Theorising Disability in Music, British musicologist Paul Attinello says that much of the music of the HIV/AIDS epidemic was written in response to a climate of fear, mourning or existential crises around the prospect of death. ‘‘They always seem to outline inevitable and terrible futures, the kinds of futures that a dreaded ‘progressive’ disease apparently must, by definition, reach,’’ he says. I Will Survive singer Gloria Gaynor.Credit:AP But other music during the darkest days of that epidemic managed to mix defiance and energy with a certain optimism, even when co-opted from earlier years: I Will Survive (Gloria Gaynor, 1978) and Don’t Leave Me This Way (Thelma Houston, 1976) became anthemic in their high-spirited acknowledgment of both grief and a determination to rise up with dignity. And as Attinello writes, there were other songs that were unafraid of the more uncomfortable emotions and ideas around AIDS, such as rage ‘‘and in some cases a vicious comic malice’’. He even found some that were optimistic and life-positive, refusing to be pulled into the ‘‘chilly drain’’ of a death-future. Even so, the melancholy can also be beautiful. Polish composer Henryk Gorecki’s Symphony No.3, Op.36, also known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, was composed in 1976 and has been interpreted in multiple ways, from a dedication to Gorecki’s wife, to a Holocaust memorial, to a compendium of Polish history. But in the 1990s, when the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs was used for many a movie soundtrack, it became a staple offering at the funerals of gay men struck down in their prime. Now, with another indiscriminate virus afoot, it will be fascinating to see what new music tries to capture in the age of COVID-19: certainly the grief and isolation, but hopefully the resilient strands of hope and connection felt during this sudden change to our existence.

The stunning natural scenery and rich Aboriginal culture of East Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory draws around 20,000 tourists to one of the most remote corners of Australia each year. Singer-songwriter Yirrmal Marika, grandson of the former lead singer of Yothu Yindi, will perform as part of a virtual concert series to promote Yolngu culture.  Tourism is the lifeblood for the local Yolngu people, who are passionate about sharing their cultural traditions, but the industry has all but collapsed after strict travel restrictions barred all non-essential travel to the region to protect Indigenous communities from the spread of COVID-19. Several major festivals have been cancelled, leaving performers and Indigenous tourism providers in the lurch. In a bid to bolster support, Yolngu Radio and non-profit economic development company Developing East Arnhem Limited have commissioned an online concert series, East Arnhem Live, to bring a slice of Yolngu culture to lounge rooms across Australia. Concerts will be broadcast from iconic tropical locations at sunset.  ""It supports our local artists who have been affected, but also provides an opportunity to promote our beautiful region to a broader audience,"" said Jordy Bowman, CEO of Developing East Arnhem. ""Everyone obviously understands the need to protect the residents of the region and stop coronavirus from getting here, but obviously [there are] a lot of disappointed people who were looking forward to a really strong tourism season."" Featuring many local Indigenous musicians and dancers, the sunset concerts will be broadcast from iconic tropical locations. East Arnhem Land has long been fertile ground for talented artists, producing top musical acts, including Yothu Yindi and the late Gurrumul Yunupingu.

Kindergarten student Hunter Curtis has adapted to home-schooling. ""I have started getting the girls into school uniforms as it differentiates their learning time from their relaxation time,"" Waterhouse said. ""We are trying to maintain the routine but they are still so young so we are not stressing about it too much, we want them to be as happy as possible during these uncertain times."" Public relations maven Roxy Jacenko says her family are prepared to teach Pixie, 8, and Hunter, 5, from home when the school term commences - with some professional help. ""Over the past four weeks, I have been working with a former school teacher for two hours a day to assist me with both kids,"" Jacenko said. ""The work of an eight-year-old is far more complex than I can ever remember."" Former rugby league star Braith Anasta and his fiance Rachael Lee have juggled their primary school childrens' education as well as managing a toddler. Braith Anasta and fiance Rachael Lee have their hands full managing home-schooling and a toddler.Credit:Instagram ""It has come with its challenges, especially the first full week of home-schooling,"" says Rachel. ""I was definitely a little overwhelmed - as were the kids!"" The eastern suburbs couple share one-year-old daughter Gigi. Lee has son Addison, 9, from a previous relationship and Anasta co-parents daughter Aleeia, 6, with her former partner. ""As much as it's a fun time having extra time with the kids, I want routine back and kids back at school,"" says Lee. ""I know that may not happen for next term, so will keep just making the best out of the situation and making the right decision for us as a family."" Last week NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was consulting stakeholders, including school principals and teachers, ahead of a return to the classroom slated for week three of term two (from May 11).

He's not, of course. He's stuck at home in Fairfield with all gigs, travel and projects cancelled. Joseph 'Jof' O'FarrellCredit:Chris Hopkins ""For me and a lot of my peers it's been a big shock,"" he says. ""No-one knows what's next."" Except that, thanks to the City of Melbourne, he does now. O'Farrell is one of 226 artists awarded funding in the first round of the City of Melbourne's COVID-19 creatives package: $4000 each out of $2 million to invest in new works and the digital translation of performances. He's going to use it to adopt his 10 Minute Dance Parties to the digital realm. The parties are a collaboration with young people: he teaches them DJ skills then runs dance parties in a shipping container. He's hosted them at London's Tate Modern; toured to Finland and Germany. Now he's going to try to turn them into a ""Loungeroom Dance Jam"". ""This project is aimed at creating a work to give respite to guardians and parents looking after children, while still trying to inspire creativity and dancing,"" O'Farrell says. ""The community element is central to every artwork I make. ""It's really great the City of Melbourne have done this, it's an acknowledgement that arts are an important part of the fabric of the city. And it's super-important right now because everyone is freaking out."" Councillor Rohan Leppert says the city is trying to support as many artists as possible at this difficult time. They received almost 2000 applications, and their independent assessors are still going through them to dole out the rest of the $2 million. ""We're all consuming more art at the moment than we normally would, stuck at home, but a lot of that is international content,"" Leppert says. ""These grants are presenting a lot more Melbourne art to Melbourne locals and that's a wonderful thing."" The money is being given to musicians, filmmakers and theatremakers among many others. Filmmaker Isabel Peppard will get started on a ""stop-motion virtual reality project"" that will take participants inside the human heart, where immersive animated scenes will ""explore the emotional complexity of love"". Peppard has had the idea for ages but ""the current situation lends itself to doing something in animation or VR - because I can't work with any crew members"" she says, a little mournfully. Luckily she started her career in stop-motion animation in the early 2000s, so has skills which she can fall back on. And Sarah Barton is going to put together an online archive of interviews with disability advocates from Australian history - influential figures such as the man who campaigned for Melbourne's first disabled parking spot. The interviews were gathered for a documentary, Defiant Lives, but the new funding will help Barton show ""great stories"" in full as a historical and educational resource.

The Canberra institution spent almost half its acquisition budget for the year on the controversial American artist's animatronic sculpture, which director Nick Mitzevich said will be a ""work of art that becomes a destination"". The highly-anticipated unveiling of Cube was due to take place in early 2021 but has been pushed back to at least June next year, as travel bans have caused production delays and prevented the US artist and his team of technical specialists from visiting Australia to install and test the interactive work. The National Gallery of Australia commissioned Jordan Wolfson's latest work, Cube, for $6.8 million.Credit:Krista Kennell/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images But art critics haven't suspended their judgment, excoriating the acquisition as a ""cultural slap in the face"" and a ""total waste of money"". The NGA has described the work as a lifelike, large-scale mirrored cube with arms that ""crawls, poses, thrashes around and dances to music"" in response to the movements of viewers. Jordan is a great salesman and he is a great provocateur and he is a showman – but he is also an incredibly thoughtful artist. Evoking Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles, which the NGA famously acquired for $1.3 million in 1973 and is now worth as much as $350 million, Mitzevich said Cube embodies the institution's mandate to ""buy works that will write the art history books"". Jordan Wolfson's 2016 Colored Sculpture was acquired by the Tate Modern. Credit:Dan Bradica/David Zwirmer Gallery/Sadie Coles HQ ""I can't see that anyone could say that buying Jordan Wolfson is a risk. He is in the world's leading collections.

Wolfson is most known for his interactive animatronic sculptures that provoke questions about contemporary culture including technology, mass media and the tension between reality and artificiality. Female Figure (2014) consists of a hyper-sexualised robotic woman with platinum blonde hair, thigh-high boots, a short dress and a face mask, who dances in front of a mirror and uses facial recognition software to make eye contact with viewers. Colored Sculpture (2016), which has been acquired by the Tate Modern, sees a cartoonish, child-like figure attached to chains, swung through the air and crashed to the ground. The NGA will be the first institution in the southern hemisphere to own a Wolfson work, with the Cube its most costly purchase since Lucian Freud's After Cezanne was acquired for $7.4 million in 2001. Mitzevich said it was Wolfson's most ambitious work yet. ""Jordan is a great salesman and he is a great provocateur and he is a showman – but he is also an incredibly thoughtful artist that pushes the boundaries of art,"" Mitzevich said. But some are sceptical that provocation will lead to posterity. Pulitzer-Prize winning critic Sebastian Smee, an Australian who now writes on art for The Washington Post, said the motivation behind the acquisition was ""so transparent it's embarrassing"" with the NGA ""banking on the benefits of publicity"". ""Jordan Wolfson's work strikes me as exactly the sort of thing Nick Mitzevich would want the National Gallery to buy.

Artist and critic Adam Geczy, who teaches at the Sydney College of the Arts, said he believed the NGA had long used Blue Poles as a justification for ""highly dubious"" exorbitant purchases. He described the Wolfson acquisition as ""astonishing"" and a ""cultural slap in the face"". ""At a time when artists and curators are exploring alternative identities and looking at alternative cultural narratives, for the NGA to have parachuted down a straight, white male with an enviable art pedigree from New York, the global centre for art, and for top dollar to boot, is absurd,"" Dr Geczy said.

The Canberra institution spent almost half its acquisition budget for the year on the controversial American artist's animatronic sculpture, which director Nick Mitzevich said will be a ""work of art that becomes a destination"". The highly-anticipated unveiling of Cube was due to take place in early 2021 but has been pushed back to at least June next year, as travel bans have caused production delays and prevented the US artist and his team of technical specialists from visiting Australia to install and test the interactive work. The National Gallery of Australia commissioned Jordan Wolfson's latest work, Cube, for $6.8 million.Credit:Krista Kennell/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images But art critics haven't suspended their judgment, excoriating the acquisition as a ""cultural slap in the face"" and a ""total waste of money"". The NGA has described the work as a lifelike, large-scale mirrored cube with arms that ""crawls, poses, thrashes around and dances to music"" in response to the movements of viewers. Jordan is a great salesman and he is a great provocateur and he is a showman – but he is also an incredibly thoughtful artist. Evoking Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles, which the NGA famously acquired for $1.3 million in 1973 and is now worth as much as $350 million, Mitzevich said Cube embodies the institution's mandate to ""buy works that will write the art history books"".

From Wim Delvoye’s poo-making machine to Greg Taylor’s plaster casts of vaginas, to Marina Abramović’s disturbing performance videos, they loved it all. The moral of the story? There are several options: ""Cloaca Professional"" by Wim Delvoye caused excitement at the opening on MONA in 2011.Credit:Peter Mathew So when we learn the National Gallery of Australia has just paid USD$5 million ($6.8 million) for the Cube, a new animatronic sculpture by the self-styled bad boy of contemporary art Jordan Wolfson, it reignites the debate about the value of work that sets out to shock and offend. Wolfson has made a lucrative career out of large-scale, factory-made sculptures that trample taboos – flirting with anti-Semitism (even though he’s Jewish), racism and misogyny.   In big exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale, one might view and forget hundreds of works in a single day, but Wolfson makes sure he can’t be ignored – through scale, noise, or a deliberate nastiness that lingers in the mind. He’s an irritant on the body of art. ""Colored sculpture"", 2016, by Jordan WolfsonCredit:Photo: Dan Bradica/David Zwirmer Gallery/Sadie Coles HQ It’s a deliberate strategy that reveals much about the artist himself, whose attention-seeking is right out in the open. Matters get more jumbled when one reads statements and interviews in which Wolfson talks about the work in terms of ""form"", as if he were making geometric abstractions. Offence, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder, with the artist merely the conduit that translates the world into images and objects. This stance has been identified as “plausible deniability”, meaning that Wolfson can take a step back if things get too hot. As a method, it’s neatly attuned to a world of “fake news” and “provisional truths” in which some are not  held accountable for their words or actions. Even so, it’s patently absurd to dwell on the formal qualities of a work such as Female Figure (2014) – an animatronic erotic dancer, wearing a witch mask – or Real Violence (2017), a virtual reality piece in which the artist beats an animatronic dummy to a pulp while Hanukkah blessings are intoned in the background. It’s reminiscent of Balthus telling his biographer, Nicholas Fox Weber, that there’s no eroticism in his work, claiming his most notorious painting, The Guitar Lesson (1934), was just something knocked off when he was young and wanted to be provocative. Yet this image of a music teacher holding her young pupil draped over her lap, a hand raised above her exposed pudenda, has only grown more outrageous over time. The Guitar Lesson is, quite simply, one of the most deviant images ever produced by a major artist, made even creepier by its borrowing from the Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, in the Louvre, in which Mary holds the dead Christ on her lap. But even Balthus’s most vehement detractors can’t deny his abilities as a painter, or his genius for creating striking, memorable images. Such a mix of talent and perversity will always be more combustible than a large, animatronic work produced in a factory to the artist’s specifications. Balthus’s offensive painting has stood the test of time, remaining just as unnerving as when first unveiled. The jury is still out as to whether Wolfson will be hailed as one of the major artists of our era, or whether his brand of calculated offensiveness will simply splutter into insignificance. A recent article in The New Yorker suggested that many of the artist’s friends and champions may be  quietly withdrawing their support, worn out by his antics and his abrasive personality. The article also tells us that Wolfson wanted the Cube to have its debut in “a prominent American museum”, but there were no takers. Instead, the work will be revealed to the public at the National Gallery of Australia later this year, at a vast social distance from the centres of the contemporary art world. Director Nick Mitzevich will want us to see this as an incredible coup for Canberra, but it could just as easily be interpreted as a last resort for an agent provocateur who seems to be  wearing out his shock value at home. Either way, this is the sort of money that should only be paid for a work of indubitable importance that will still seem fresh in 20 or 50 years time. And this is where Jackson Pollock’s Blue Poles keeps getting dragged into the press coverage. Purchased for $1.3 million in 1973 by the NGA’s founding director, James Mollison, it is now valued at around $150 million, although it would be impossible to make a realistic valuation. Every time an Australian museum buys an expensive work, Blue Poles is invoked by way of comparison, but nothing has ever come close. Certainly not the arguably woeful Takashi Murakami painting acquired by the Art Gallery of NSW last year, for an undisclosed sum in the millions, and most probably not Wolfson’s Cube. Mitzevich has enjoyed the odd succès-de-scandale in the past, notably with We are all flesh (2012), a sculpture by Berlinde De Bruyckere made from a horse carcass, which caused a stir at the Art Gallery of South Australia. It’s a much bigger ask to expect audiences to come racing to Canberra to see the work of an American artist  who is largely unknown in Australia. Berlinde De Bruyckere's We Are All Flesh at the Art Gallery of South Australia.Credit:Sam Noonan  With Blue Poles, many who came to jeer at the painting found they were won over by Pollock’s compelling, rhythmic composition. It’s an experience that is renewed with every viewing, but whatever we get from Wolfson’s Cube is unlikely  going to require prolonged meditation. The danger is that the NGA has spent a lot of money on what might be described as a novelty work, the shock value of which may not be sufficient to draw visitors in large numbers or have much lasting impact. If Mitzevich wants to be known as a risk-taker, he has made a bold step in that direction. In the contemporary art scene, it has become hard to listen to those artists and curators who like to imagine they are showing works of art that threaten the status quo, uproot stale convention and slaughter sacred cows. The very fact that such pieces may be shown in the antiseptic, institutional space of the museum tends to undermine their iconoclastic value. They are as harmless as stuffed animals in glass cases, made to look fierce by a little skilful taxidermy. The abiding problem with art intended to shock and offend is that it can very swiftly lose its edge once viewers have grasped the general idea. Sometimes, as with Andres Serrano’s Piss Christ (1987), which depicted a crucifix dipped in a jar of urine, the gesture is so puerile it shouldn’t be dignified by public anger and protest. Or take the case of an artist such as Juan Davila, who came to prominence for his painting Stupid as a Painter in 1982, which struck a new note in Australian art with its Pop savagery. As the years have rolled by Davila’s provocations have suffered from a law of diminishing returns. When outrageous gestures are eagerly expected, they never seem outrageous enough upon arrival.

The paradox is that works by such allegedly subversive artists are being purchased for millions of dollars by government-funded museums. What they offer is not a threat to our bourgeois values but a confirmation of them.

Out of the pile teetering by the chair, I plucked The Extraordinary Story of the Apple, by Barrie Juniper and David Mabberly, published late last year by Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. Just as apple growers all over the country celebrate their harvest; how timely. Granny Smiths, first developed by Maria Smith in Ryde in 1868, are one of the world's favourites.Credit:Luke Torrevillas The cradle of the apple, I learned, is Tian Shan, a mountainous area between the Stans and north-west China. Tian Shan did not freeze over in the Ice Age, allowing an early form of apple, evolved around 10 million years ago, to continue its evolution. Apples are cross-pollinated, so seedlings are never the same as either parent. This characteristic, allied with the geography of the Tian Shan, created a great diversified orchard of apples, each one different, and many bearing sweet fruit. Those sweet apples started moving west when horses were domesticated about 7000 years ago. Horses love apples and the seeds survive their digestion to arrive back on the earth in a fertile package. As people and horses moved between civilisations in the Yangtze Valley and Tigris and Euphrates rivers, they helped move the apple, especially the sought-after sweet ones, further west. So by the time Persian kings were building paradise gardens 2500 years ago, apples we would recognise were part of the treasure.   Sydney’s contribution to the story of the apple is the “Granny Smith”, spotted as a seedling with potential by Maria, aka Granny, Smith in 1868. The Smiths had an orchard on the edge of the Field of Mars Common in what is now Ryde. Granny Smith died in 1870, sadly well before her eponymous apple was selected for commercial development and became an international sensation. The canny Granny Smith herself.Credit:Fairfax By the middle of the 20th century, “Grannies” had overtaken the American seedling “Golden Delicious” as the most commonly grown apple in the world. In 2017, “Granny” was still holding her own with 11.1 per cent of commercial apple production. (Incomprehensibly, the current world leader is the bland New Zealand “Gala”. Give me a tart “Granny Smith” any day, or preferably a fresh “Pink Lady”, developed in Western Australia in 1973.) Apple varieties need a certain number of days of winter chilling to fruit well, and Sydney is too mild for most. “Granny Smith” is an exception. Edible gardener Bridget Kennedy grows both “Granny Smith” and “Pink Lady” in her Lane Cove garden. The latter doesn’t do much more than provide cross-pollination for the “Granny” but the “Granny”, still only six years old, does well. Or well enough. There are easier fruits to grow in Sydney than the apple, but home gardening isn’t a business, and plants can earn a place for their meaning, as much as their produce. “I think of the apples I grow as a high-end luxury crop in my garden,” says Kennedy.

So this Mother’s Day, reopen this shuttered world for the woman who brought you into it. Photo: Getty ImagesCredit:  Greenwood, Canadian writer Michael Christie’s third book, is a multi-layered family saga that opens in 2038 with Jake Greenwood working as a tourist guide at one of the world’s last old-growth forests, on an island off British Columbia. It moves back in time to tell the story of her ancestors, starting in 1908 when two young boys are the sole survivors of a train collision. Harris becomes a successful businessman, while Everett makes a decision that will reverberate for the rest of his life. A riveting tale of love, greed, sacrifice and betrayal – and an ode to the beauty of trees. American writer Kiley Reid’s highly entertaining debut novel, Such a Fun Age, pokes fun at well-intentioned white liberals while casting a serious eye over race relations, class and gender in the United States today. In the opening scene a young black woman, Emira, is with Briar, the little white girl she babysits, in a supermarket when a security guard accuses her of kidnapping Briar. Alix, Briar’s prissy, uptight mother, is mortified and tries to make it up to Emira by becoming her new best friend. Little do the two women know they have something significant in common. Witty, wry social satire. Irish novelist Colum McCann’s 10th novel, Apeirogon (it means a shape with a “countably infinite” number of sides), is based on the real-life friendship between Rami, an Israeli whose daughter was killed by suicide bombers, and Bassam, a Palestinian whose daughter was shot dead by an Israeli soldier. Despite their grief and anger, both men are fiercely committed to peace. McCann tells their story in 1001 short chapters, rich in cultural references – including Sinead O’Connor, the Crusades, Sigmund Freud and Schindler’s List – and historical detail about the Arab-Israeli conflict, seen from both perspectives. A superbly crafted testament to the power of empathy and forgiveness. Canadian writer Emily St. John Mandel, whose bestselling novel Station Eleven about a post-apocalyptic world now seems eerily timely, has set her new one, The Glass Hotel, in a different milieu – the world of high finance, glamorous hotels and gorgeous women. New York high-flyer Jonathan Alkaitis walks into the bar of his luxury hotel on Vancouver Island and is immediately taken by Vincent, a beautiful young bartender with a troubled past. He whisks her away and introduces her to a life of wealth and prestige, but it turns out the foundations are shaky. A page-turner.   If there was ever a time to tap into your inner domestic goddess, this is it. The shortage of sugar and flour on supermarket shelves suggests I’m not the only one comfort baking, and two new books provide endless inspiration. Now for Something Sweet, the latest offering from the Monday Morning Cooking Club, is a lovingly curated collection of sweet recipes from Jewish households around the world, accompanied by the heart-warming stories of their origins. From almond meringue torte for entertaining to Persian shortbread to dip into a cup of tea, there’s something in this glorious selection of biscuits, cakes, tarts and slices to tempt even the most reluctant baker. In Natalie Paull’s Beatrix Bakes, named after her much-loved bakery in North Melbourne, she shows how to create her amazing cakes and desserts, with illustrated instructions on how to make dough, assemble a layer cake and bake the perfect cookie. Whether your mum wants to wow them at a dinner party with lemon curd cream crepe cake or spoil the grandkids with two-bite jammy tartlets, this book will bring a smile to her face. If your mum likes flavoursome, nourishing food with a hint of the exotic, give her Falastin: a Cookbook, featuring Palestinian recipes by Sami Tamimi, co-founder of the Yotam Ottolenghi empire, and Tara Wigley, who helps write Ottolenghi recipes. There are new twists on old favourites such as shakshuka as well as uniquely Palestinian recipes like chicken musakhan, and the recipes are both accessible and achievable. With its evocative photography and powerful stories about the region and its people, Falastin is as much a cultural history as a cookbook. Suzanne Leal’s third novel, The Deceptions, is about a relationship between Hana, a young Jewish woman in the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia during World War II, and Karel, one of her guards. Karel, a married man, is besotted; Hana, more pragmatic, is grateful for his kindness and needs his protection. When she loses it, she faces the horrors of the concentration camps. Meanwhile, in modern Australia, Tessa is having an affair with her married boss when she meets Jon, a kind, attentive Englishman who shows her what a good relationship looks like. The threads of these two stories are woven together seamlessly in a cracker of an ending. A powerful story, sensitively told. Award-winning writer Anna Goldsworthy’s first novel, Melting Moments, is a charming, highly engaging story about the life of Ruby Jenkins, which opens during World War II and is set in Melbourne and Adelaide. Ruby does the right thing all her life – she marries kind, dependable Arthur, becomes a devoted mother, enjoys gardening and cooking and manages her tricky mother-in-law. On the surface her life is perfect, but she wonders sometimes if there might be something more out there. Goldsworthy writes beautifully and has created a memorable character in Ruby. A joy to read. Photo: Getty ImagesCredit:  The mum who enjoys literary biography and Australian women’s writing will devour acclaimed biographer Brenda Niall’s Friends & Rivals, about the intersecting lives of four Australian writers between the 1890s and 1920s. Ethel Turner and Henry Handel Richardson are well known, Barbara Baynton and Nettie Palmer (a book critic) less so, but Niall’s lively account of their personal and writing lives and their relationships with each other at a time when women’s writing was undervalued is as entertaining as it is illuminating. Unfinished Business: Notes of a Chronic Re-reader, a collection of essays by New York City memoirist Vivian Gornick, is about the joys of returning to old favourites at different stages in life. Gornick examines her own reading life, noting that she reads D.H. Lawrence’s Sons and Lovers quite differently in her mature years compared to how she first read it at 20. Similarly, as a new cat owner, Gornick found that Doris Lessing’s Particularly Cats did not speak to her, but after many years of feline companionship, she reads it in one sitting. A fascinating insight into a book lover’s reading habits and the books she returns to. Grandmothers, edited by journalist Helen Elliott, is a collection of 24 essays by well-known Australian women about being, and having, grandmothers. For Helen Garner, being one means feeling useful and entertained. Jane Caro likes who she is with her grandchildren; more patient than she was as a mother. Elizabeth Chong appreciates the joy of unconditional love without the stress of responsibility. Maggie Beer rolls pasta, reads poetry and picks herbs with her grandchildren. Perfect for the grandma in your life. Rarely has a book been as perfectly timed and desperately needed as Julia Baird’s third book, Phosphorescence: on Awe, Wonder and Things That Sustain You When the World Goes Dark. Drawing on her own experience of surviving three major cancer surgeries, Baird offers hard-won insights into what gets you through when times are tough. She writes of the joy to be found in communing with nature, celebrating imperfection, valuing friendship, paying attention – and the importance of holding on to hope. Exquisitely written and perfectly pitched. To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.

The sight of this ‘‘petite, elfin-featured woman, armed with painting gear and parasol, negotiating murky swamps and snake-infested jungles in full Victorian attire’’, says Christine Morton-Evans, ‘‘amazed all who came across her’’. Controversial and undaunted by convention, she pursued her botanical specimens in dangerous locations with the zeal of one seeking the holy grail. She won innumerable medals for her paintings and became a household name both for her work and her embellished reports of her intrepid adventures. Yet she is now largely forgotten. For all the drama and tragedy of her life, her sometimes delicate, sometimes luscious, paintings steal the show in this handsome publication that, a century after her death, restores her work to its rightful place in the public gaze. Valkyrie: The Women of the Viking WorldJohanna Katrin FridriksdottirBloomsbury, $40  Credit:  There’s little evidence that Viking women fought in battle as popular television drama would have it. Yet Norse sagas are full of powerful, ferocious heroines, from the valkyries – supernatural beings who decide who will die in battle – to vengeful, blood-thirsty queens who use their children as political pawns. While historically unreliable, the sagas highlight the ‘‘horrific costs’’ women paid in ‘‘an unyielding culture of honor’’, says Johanna Katrin Fridriksdottir. At the same time, however, Norse laws gave married and widowed women considerable rights and security. The author’s dilemma, in this scholarly study, is to reconcile the larger-than-life legends of monstrous mothers and terrifying shield maidens with the more mundane and complex reality of daily life for Viking women from childhood to old age. The School of RestorationAlice Achan & Philippa TyndaleAllen & Unwin, $32.99  Credit:  ‘‘Why am I still alive,’’ Alice Achan asked herself, ‘‘when almost every person I rose for each morning is gone?’’ Her happy childhood in a village in northern Uganda had been shattered by the Lord’s Resistance Army and she was paralysed by grief. After years of struggling to get an education and a diploma in social work, she still felt overwhelmed by the brutal experiences of girls who had been abducted by rebels. An urgent desire took hold of her to open a school for these survivors of sexual violence. ‘‘In the school of my dreams, girls would be nurtured by their teachers, and learn that they are equal to any other person.’’ Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this against-all-odds story of the academy she founded is Achan’s and her students’ conviction that only forgiveness ‘‘can release us from the bondage of bitterness’’. On HopeDaisy JeffreyHachette, $16.99  Credit:  When Daisy Jeffrey, one of the organisers of the School Strike 4 Climate, was asked to write this essay, it was to be ‘‘On Change’’, which she regarded as ‘‘a hell of a lot easier than ‘On Hope’ ’’. Not surprisingly, given the patronising opposition that the movement is up against, this essay – bursting with the energy and longing of adolescence – swings between hope and despair as Jeffrey struggles to keep up with her school work while taking to the world stage to give voice to young peoples’ fears for the future. In documenting how she became an activist, she demonstrates that the only lasting antidote to the feelings of helplessness that breed despair is working for change.

70,/culture/books/fiction-reviews-the-night-watchman-and-three-other-titles-20200417-p54kti.html,Fiction reviews: The Night Watchman and three other titles,"PICK OF THE WEEKThe Night WatchmanLouise ErdrichCorsair, $32.99  Credit:  Louise Erdrich was inspired to write The Night Watchman by the experience of her grandfather – a Chippewa man who lived on the Turtle Mountain reservation in North Dakota and who fought, in the 1950s, to stop the US government from dispossessing his people of their land. Thomas Wazhushk is a night watchman galvanised into action that will take him to Washington D.C. to save his community. We also follow his niece Patrice, a factory-worker with an alcoholic father, and sole breadwinner for her family. Patrice leaves the reservation for the first time determined to find her sister Vera, last seen in Minnesota. Although Thomas’ political battle has momentous consequence, what stands out is more intimate: the telling detail, the warmth and compassion Erdrich brings to her portrayal of characters struggling to navigate two worlds. The Night of All SoulsPhilippa SwanVintage, $32.99  Credit:  In lockdown I recently reread Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence. Was there ever a writer so sharp, so acidic in her assessment of society, yet so generous in her imagination of the people trapped within it? In The Night of All Souls, she returns from the grave. Philippa Swan’s erudite homage takes a page from Wharton’s unheralded ghost stories: the author is resurrected in an anteroom to the afterlife, and given a novella about a woman who works at the Wharton museum in Massachusetts. Edith must decide whether to publish or burn the work, revisiting her own writing in the process. It may have the trappings of a ghost story, but the most appealing element of Swan’s novel is its submerged literary appreciation of Wharton’s oeuvre, delivered in tandem with lively elements of biography, and shades of the wit and style for which Wharton was renowned. Gathering EvidenceMartin MacInnesAtlantic, $29.99  Credit:  Abstract, unnerving quasi-detective fiction with traces of absurdist dystopia, Gathering Evidence draws a husband and wife into parallel investigations. It begins with a treatise on a new social media app called Nest, which collates user data and derives a unique pattern from it. Soon, no one can make serious life decisions without consulting their patterns. That menacing prospect hovers as we meet John, a programmer with a large tech company, and his wife Shel, a primatologist. Shel travels to Africa to investigate the death of bonobos in a national park. Plans change and a dangerous situation develops. Meanwhile, John is attacked by an unknown assailant, and wakes up to visits from an anonymous medico; he must piece together his memories to discover what is happening to him and why. MacInnes has created a strangely prescient vision that fuses risks of ecological catastrophe, technological dependence, and social isolation. Hitler’s PeacePhilip KerrHachette, $32.99  Credit:  The late Philip Kerr’s historical detective novels (set in Nazi Germany and featuring Bernie Gunther, a former policeman turned private investigator) were more than entertaining bestsellers. And if fans can’t look forward to further books in the series, there’s still Hitler’s Peace, which offers a twist-riddled and meticulously constructed espionage thriller wrapped in alternate history. It’s autumn, 1943 and Willard Mayer – philosophy professor, lothario and US spy – has been sent to Tehran by Roosevelt for the Allied conference with Churchill and Stalin. Knowing the war cannot be won, Hitler wants peace and only Churchill won’t negotiate. Enter Mayer, whose shadowy career may have involved being a double- and even triple-agent, and the stage is set for a spy novel with very high stakes. Kerr writes with great style and intelligence and departs from history with convincing plausibility. Copyright © 2020", Cameron Woodhead ,"April 24, 2020"
71,/culture/books/fiction-reviews-the-night-watchman-and-three-other-titles-20200417-p54kti.html,Fiction reviews: The Night Watchman and three other titles,"PICK OF THE WEEKThe Night WatchmanLouise ErdrichCorsair, $32.99  Credit:  Louise Erdrich was inspired to write The Night Watchman by the experience of her grandfather – a Chippewa man who lived on the Turtle Mountain reservation in North Dakota and who fought, in the 1950s, to stop the US government from dispossessing his people of their land. Thomas Wazhushk is a night watchman galvanised into action that will take him to Washington D.C. to save his community. We also follow his niece Patrice, a factory-worker with an alcoholic father, and sole breadwinner for her family. Patrice leaves the reservation for the first time determined to find her sister Vera, last seen in Minnesota. Although Thomas’ political battle has momentous consequence, what stands out is more intimate: the telling detail, the warmth and compassion Erdrich brings to her portrayal of characters struggling to navigate two worlds. The Night of All SoulsPhilippa SwanVintage, $32.99  Credit:  In lockdown I recently reread Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence. Was there ever a writer so sharp, so acidic in her assessment of society, yet so generous in her imagination of the people trapped within it? In The Night of All Souls, she returns from the grave. Philippa Swan’s erudite homage takes a page from Wharton’s unheralded ghost stories: the author is resurrected in an anteroom to the afterlife, and given a novella about a woman who works at the Wharton museum in Massachusetts. Edith must decide whether to publish or burn the work, revisiting her own writing in the process. It may have the trappings of a ghost story, but the most appealing element of Swan’s novel is its submerged literary appreciation of Wharton’s oeuvre, delivered in tandem with lively elements of biography, and shades of the wit and style for which Wharton was renowned.
