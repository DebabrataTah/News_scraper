Of course, it was heavenly, an experience I shall cherish for the rest of my life. It is also a treat I shall likely pay for the rest of my life, a chuck-it-all-on-the-credit-card-and-work-it-out-later break without logic and financial sense. Since returning, I have never been more broke – but there is a happy point to this story – I have never been more content to be so. You see, I am having some wonderful insights into money and, in understanding how to live somewhat frugally, I am enjoying the little things in life a whole lot more than I used to. 'A small part of me also knows that I will no longer waste money like I used to. I won’t believe the marketing hype of the new and novel. I won’t pine for what I don’t have but enjoy what I do.'Credit:iStock Today, I know that an expensive meal in a fancy restaurant is nice, but not if it equals my weekly grocery bill. So now I feed those same friends I’d dine out with, appreciating the adage that food is love by serving it at home with lots of pride and little expense. Even though I love a bargain, I can walk past all the shiny things in sale season that would normally incite desire, with the knowledge it is just stuff and I already have more than I’ll ever want or need. In doing so, I have rediscovered clothes I’ve never worn and enjoyed making them work. I go to the library and borrow books rather than shelling out for them new. I eschew the empty dreams of over-promising cosmetics and beauty products and stick to what will do the job cheaply and efficiently – no bells, whistles or fancy packaging that only ends up in landfill. I don’t need a new car; mine runs perfectly well. I don’t crave designer furniture but take pleasure in restoring an op-shop find, sanding and polishing it back to its original beauty. Instead of forking out money on presents for friends, I find their favourite photo, have it printed and place it in a reclaimed frame – something received with much more applause than a bottle of bubbly or a bouquet of flowers that will only shrivel and die. But the greatest discovery is one I never thought I’d be able to bear: accepting the generosity of others. I am – or was – the person who would always pay a bill rather than suffer the awkwardness of others counting up the cost of their meal, down to how many pieces of bread they ate or glasses of wine they imbibed. This division of money made me uncomfortable, so I took the pain away at that moment, only to pay for it later. Also, I enjoyed shouting, believing it a way to show my gratitude for fine friends and food. So when I was on that recent holiday, and friends with more money than I have insisted on paying, I swallowed my pride and accepted. It was not easy to do; in fact, I had to call my brother, a man who has always been generous to a fault, and talk it through with him. “I get where you are coming from but here’s the thing you are forgetting and I have to remember, too – other people enjoy giving just as much as you do,” he wisely advised. “If they want to pay, allow them to do it. I know you have picked up more than your share of tabs in the past. What goes around, comes around. At the moment, it’s other people’s turn. Yours will come again.” So I am allowing myself to step back and enjoy the liberality of those who wish to share it, in the knowledge that it makes them happy to do so – just as it did me. And I know that once I am back on my feet again, I’ll take pleasure in picking up the tab once more. But a small part of me also knows that I will no longer waste money like I used to. I won’t believe the marketing hype of the new and novel. I won’t pine for what I don’t have, but enjoy what I do. Because as I age, I am more aware than ever that possessions don’t make me happy, but experiences do. And if being careful about how I spend at home allows me to enjoy travelling and indulging abroad, I’m all for it.

In the absence of jam-packed calendars, people are turning to social media challenges in droves. Some bring together families for choreographed dance routines while others spark the inner artist or unlock hidden engineering skills. All of them hold the promise of warding off boredom and — maybe — earning users a moment of online celebrity. Replay   Here are some of the biggest challenges sweeping the world amid the lockdown. #FliptheSwitch Early last month, the lyrics ""I just flipped the switch"" from the Drake song Nonstop inspired a viral challenge on TikTok that eventually made its way to Instagram. All over, people began swapping clothes, poses and sometimes attitudes when the lights are switched off and then back on. A version featuring US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kate McKinnon of Saturday Night Live went viral, as did a clip of Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez. #DontRushChallenge The song Don't Rush by the British hip-hop outfit Young T & Bugsey provided the backdrop for this challenge. In some videos, participants pass around a makeup brush like a wand that magically upgrades their look. One popular take featured New Orleans police officers passing around their hats while another video highlighted disabled women and men. #PillowChallenge This challenge attracts creative fashionistas who aim to turn everyday pillows into striking quarantine couture, often using belts to fashionably fasten the pillows around their waists. Actresses Halle Berry, Tracee Ellis Ross and Anne Hathaway all participated in the craze. #BinIsolationOuting Around Australia, residents have begun dressing up as superheroes, Disney characters and sometimes dinosaurs to wheel the bins to the curb. A Facebook group called ""Bin Isolation Outing,"" which has quickly racked up nearly 1 million members, features photos and videos of residents dressing up for the usually mundane task. ""So basically the bin goes out more than us so let's dress up for the occasion!"" reads a description of the group. ""Fancy dress, makeup, tutu … be creative. Post photos to cheer us up, after all laughter is the best medicine."" The challenge has since spilled over onto Instagram and Twitter. #BetweenArtandQuarantine While the pandemic has shuttered most public institutions, museum-goers have shifted their focus online, where people are cleverly replicating famous artworks. Participants use toilet paper, food, old clothes and more to form a living archive of creativity in isolation. The Instagram account @tussenkunstenquarantaine collects and posts submissions from locked-down artists all over. Thousands of replicas appear under the hashtags #tussenkunstenquarantaine and #betweenartandquarantine. There's also a Russian Facebook group called ""Isolation"" that features at-home replicas of sculptures, paintings and movie scenes. #TrickShot When boredom sets in, silly tasks are sometimes the most entertaining, as evidenced by the millions of TikTok, Instagram and Twitter videos posted with the hashtag #trickshot. The objective is to land the shot, no matter how many obstacles or how ridiculous the task. Some popular videos show Ping-Pong balls bouncing off pots and pans or going through complicated courses. Although Ping-Pong balls are commonly used, people have recorded their own #trickshot videos using basketballs, soccer balls and golf balls. Your First Move Is Their Last Move This challenge turns family living rooms and kitchens into makeshift nightclubs, where everyone gets a turn on the dance floor. The conceit: Repeat the dance move from the person in front of you, then add your own twist for the person behind you to replicate.

While Mackintosh and his team normally specialise in weight, exercise and body image, they made it clear that these sessions were to treat more general mental health concerns related to the pandemic rather than weight concerns. So Mackintosh was surprised by the requests that came back. Please stop worrying about ""corona kilos"".Credit:iStock “Even at a time like this, almost all of the people who responded still listed eating, weight and body image worries as their main concern.” With social media awash with “experts” peddling tips to avoid “corona kilos” you’d be forgiven for thinking that COVID-19 was a metabolic condition associated with excess weight gain rather than a deadly respiratory illness. As actress and activist Jameela Jamil posted after seeing “toxic influencers” ratcheting up people’s body image anxiety due to the changes in diet and exercise regimes, “Don’t worry about losing weight right now in this moment... just survive.” Jamil’s advice is echoed by Dr Nikki Stamp, a cardiothoracic surgeon and author of Pretty Unhealthy: Why our obsession with looking healthy is making us sick. “The focus should not be on gaining or losing weight right now,” says Stamp. “What is probably more likely to be motivating is to focus on the benefits of healthy behaviours that don't have anything to do with appearance. “Thinking about the enjoyment aspect of exercise is far more likely to lead to us actually participating in behaviours that are good for our overall health.” Stamp says that food is comforting and there's nothing wrong with eating for enjoyment, especially in the high stress environment we're all in right now. But if food is our only coping mechanism we would benefit from looking for other ways to get some relief. “Mental health experts are recommending strategies such as keeping in contact with loved ones, gentle exercise, mindfulness or meditation practices and of course, talking through your problems if need be,” says Stamp. General practitioner Dr Mark McGrath says it’s important to keep our social isolation in perspective and remember that any weight gain is likely to be short-term. “While it's important not to dilute the main message of stay home and what to do if you become sick, my advice is that it's normal for body weight to fluctuate a little,” says McGrath. “Pay attention to your hunger signals, mostly eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full, but it's OK to eat for pleasure sometimes too. Make an occasion of meals and eat together with those in isolation with you.” To be clear, not obsessing about weight is not the same as not caring about your health. Mackintosh, who is the author of Thinsanity: 7 Steps to Transform Your Mindset and Say Goodbye to Dieting Forever, says that now more than ever, health is about balance. It’s about looking after our inner selves as well as our outer selves. “Of course, health is important,” says Mackintosh. “But you’re going to struggle if you try and press on with your health goals ignoring that we’re in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. Similarly, if you abandon all of your health goals and values, you’re probably not going to feel great either. “It’s important to cultivate some perspective. People are dying — people are losing their jobs. If all you get out of this is a couple of ‘corona kilos’, you’re probably pretty lucky.” The goal of any exercise should be about nurturing our physical and mental health, rather than punishing ourselves for not reaching a weight loss goal. Accredited practising dietitian and health coach Shivaun Conn says that we are all under so much stress and pressure right now it’s important to put the body shame and weight guilt on hold. “It’s detrimental to our mental health to feel guilty if we don’t work out every single day,” says Conn. “When we feel guilty about not performing our concept of what perfect health behaviours are, we may be saying to ourselves, ‘I did a bad thing, I’m not good enough, other people do better, why can’t I be as motivated as other people, what’s wrong with me?’. This can lead to a cascade of negative thinking that feeds into unhelpful beliefs about oneself.” Conn says that feelings of failure and inadequacy can decrease our motivation to start or continue with healthy behaviours. “These beliefs tend to feed thoughts such as, ‘there’s no point in trying or continuing with healthy behaviours as I will never succeed or be good enough’,” says Conn. So what should you do if you’ve been bingeing on Tim Tams and haven’t gotten off the couch for a couple of weeks and are now starting to worry about ""corona kilos""? “Feeling bad about what you did won’t change the past,” says Conn, adding that we are all doing our best to cope with the current situation. Conn suggests looking ahead and thinking about what you could do now or tomorrow to make yourself feel good and to look after yourself. “How can you move your body in a way that will be kind to it, feel good and look after it?” “How can you move your body in a way that will be kind to it, feel good and look after it?,” says Conn. “Just 30 minutes of moderate activity (such as a brisk walk) on most days, has been shown to be enough to support our immune system, as well as our mental and overall physical health.” At a time when people are losing their lives, losing their loved ones, losing their jobs, losing their communities, our losing weight is one more worry we can do without. We have heard many times that kindness is key to get us through this crisis. This includes kindness to ourselves. Rather than waging war with our bodies and loathing them for weight gain and other perceived imperfections, we should appreciate them for giving us the precious gift of life.

6,/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/how-many-times-a-week-you-should-exercise-to-see-real-mood-benefits-20200422-p54m3g.html,How many times a week you should exercise to see real mood benefits,"During these trying times, exercise could provide indispensable mental health support for many of us, according to a timely new study. The study, which involved a four-day-a-week exercise regimen, finds that among a generally healthy but sedentary group of adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s, working out lowers levels of depression, hostility and other negative feelings. The study also finds that the mood benefits of exercise can linger for weeks after people stop working out, offering another compelling reason for us to try to move, whenever and wherever we still can, during this coronavirus crisis. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between physical activity and lower levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and other bad moods.Credit:iStock There is plenty of evidence, of course, that physical activity affects mental health. In earlier studies, regular exercise substantially reduced risks for clinical depression among people with a genetic predisposition to the condition and helped to treat serious depression if it developed. Likewise, exercise often alleviates the severity of anxiety disorders, other research has shown. But those studies generally involved people with serious clinical conditions. In people without mood disorders, exercise research has been squishier. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between physical activity and lower levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and other bad moods. But those studies were observational, meaning they looked at people's lives and found links between regular exercise and buoyant moods. They cannot tell us whether the exercise actually caused people to feel cheerful and resilient, only that active people tend also to be relatively happy people. So for the new study, which was published in April in Health Psychology, researchers at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York City and at other institutions decided to mount one of the first experiments to test the effects of an exercise regimen on the mental health of generally healthy, although inactive, people. They hoped to see, in effect, whether people in generally good mental health – without a history of depression, anxiety or other mood disorders – could become even better adjusted and happier if they started to exercise. The scientists began by recruiting 119 sedentary adults age 20 to 45 without any known mental health problems. The scientists invited them to the lab, where they confirmed the state of their mental health with a series of questionnaires designed to measure people's current levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and anger. The researchers then randomly assigned the volunteers to two groups. One continued their normal lives and served as a control group. The others began exercising four times a week at the lab. Their exercise program was a standard moderate aerobic routine. They walked or jogged on treadmills or rode a stationary bicycle for about 35 minutes at a pace that left them somewhat breathless. (Technically, heart rates were raised to about 70 per cent to 80 per cent of each person's maximum.) This routine continued for three months. Then both groups of volunteers returned to the lab to repeat the mood questionnaires, and the members of the exercise group were asked to stop working out and resume their former inactivity for a month. Replay   ""Most of them didn't much want to quit,"" said Richard P. Sloan, a professor of behavioural medicine at Columbia who oversaw the new study. The exercising group had learnt to enjoy the exercise, he said. But they complied and avoided workouts for a month. Then everyone completed the mood questionnaires a final time, and the scientists checked for changes over the four months. As expected, they found that all 119 men and women had begun the experiment with sturdy mental health. Their scores showed them to be well-adjusted and jovial, with particularly low scores on anxiety. But the group that exercised had managed to bump down their already low numbers. After three months of working out, their overall scores on the depression scale fell by about 35 per cent, a significant difference from the control group, whose depression scores had barely budged. Hostility levels in the exercise group also plummeted. Declines in anxiety and anger were slighter, but the researchers think their volunteers began with such low levels of those feelings, they realistically could not fall much further. The mood improvements also lingered. Even after a month of inactivity, the former exercisers showed healthier scores for depression and hostility than the control group, although numbers were starting to return to where they had been at the start. Overall, the results suggest that ""exercise has real benefits for mood"", even if our moods are not dour or surly to start with, said Kathleen McIntyre, an instructor in psychiatric social work who led the study. The study did not examine how exercise might elevate our moods. But McIntyre speculated that the effects are likely to involve both physiology and psychology, with exercise altering various biological pathways related to affect and emotions, while also making exercisers feel more capable and empowered.

The study, which involved a four-day-a-week exercise regimen, finds that among a generally healthy but sedentary group of adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s, working out lowers levels of depression, hostility and other negative feelings. The study also finds that the mood benefits of exercise can linger for weeks after people stop working out, offering another compelling reason for us to try to move, whenever and wherever we still can, during this coronavirus crisis. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between physical activity and lower levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and other bad moods.Credit:iStock There is plenty of evidence, of course, that physical activity affects mental health. In earlier studies, regular exercise substantially reduced risks for clinical depression among people with a genetic predisposition to the condition and helped to treat serious depression if it developed. Likewise, exercise often alleviates the severity of anxiety disorders, other research has shown. But those studies generally involved people with serious clinical conditions. In people without mood disorders, exercise research has been squishier. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between physical activity and lower levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and other bad moods. But those studies were observational, meaning they looked at people's lives and found links between regular exercise and buoyant moods. They cannot tell us whether the exercise actually caused people to feel cheerful and resilient, only that active people tend also to be relatively happy people. So for the new study, which was published in April in Health Psychology, researchers at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York City and at other institutions decided to mount one of the first experiments to test the effects of an exercise regimen on the mental health of generally healthy, although inactive, people. They hoped to see, in effect, whether people in generally good mental health – without a history of depression, anxiety or other mood disorders – could become even better adjusted and happier if they started to exercise. The scientists began by recruiting 119 sedentary adults age 20 to 45 without any known mental health problems. The scientists invited them to the lab, where they confirmed the state of their mental health with a series of questionnaires designed to measure people's current levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and anger. The researchers then randomly assigned the volunteers to two groups. One continued their normal lives and served as a control group. The others began exercising four times a week at the lab. Their exercise program was a standard moderate aerobic routine. They walked or jogged on treadmills or rode a stationary bicycle for about 35 minutes at a pace that left them somewhat breathless. (Technically, heart rates were raised to about 70 per cent to 80 per cent of each person's maximum.) This routine continued for three months. Then both groups of volunteers returned to the lab to repeat the mood questionnaires, and the members of the exercise group were asked to stop working out and resume their former inactivity for a month. Replay   ""Most of them didn't much want to quit,"" said Richard P. Sloan, a professor of behavioural medicine at Columbia who oversaw the new study. The exercising group had learnt to enjoy the exercise, he said. But they complied and avoided workouts for a month. Then everyone completed the mood questionnaires a final time, and the scientists checked for changes over the four months. As expected, they found that all 119 men and women had begun the experiment with sturdy mental health. Their scores showed them to be well-adjusted and jovial, with particularly low scores on anxiety. But the group that exercised had managed to bump down their already low numbers. After three months of working out, their overall scores on the depression scale fell by about 35 per cent, a significant difference from the control group, whose depression scores had barely budged. Hostility levels in the exercise group also plummeted. Declines in anxiety and anger were slighter, but the researchers think their volunteers began with such low levels of those feelings, they realistically could not fall much further. The mood improvements also lingered. Even after a month of inactivity, the former exercisers showed healthier scores for depression and hostility than the control group, although numbers were starting to return to where they had been at the start. Overall, the results suggest that ""exercise has real benefits for mood"", even if our moods are not dour or surly to start with, said Kathleen McIntyre, an instructor in psychiatric social work who led the study. The study did not examine how exercise might elevate our moods. But McIntyre speculated that the effects are likely to involve both physiology and psychology, with exercise altering various biological pathways related to affect and emotions, while also making exercisers feel more capable and empowered. The study also looked only at moderate aerobic exercise and involved only adults without any known disabilities or illnesses. But the findings still have obvious relevance now, when so many of us are feeling overwhelmed by the pandemic and its potential effects on our money, mortality, family, friends and futures.

10,/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/it-s-okay-to-put-your-health-goals-on-hold-right-now-20200414-p54jo2.html,It's OK to put your health goals on hold right now,"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologist Glenn Mackintosh put out an offer for bulk-billed psychology sessions for people who were struggling with the realities of living in lockdown. While Mackintosh and his team normally specialise in weight, exercise and body image, they made it clear that these sessions were to treat more general mental health concerns related to the pandemic rather than weight concerns. So Mackintosh was surprised by the requests that came back. Please stop worrying about ""corona kilos"".Credit:iStock “Even at a time like this, almost all of the people who responded still listed eating, weight and body image worries as their main concern.” With social media awash with “experts” peddling tips to avoid “corona kilos” you’d be forgiven for thinking that COVID-19 was a metabolic condition associated with excess weight gain rather than a deadly respiratory illness. As actress and activist Jameela Jamil posted after seeing “toxic influencers” ratcheting up people’s body image anxiety due to the changes in diet and exercise regimes, “Don’t worry about losing weight right now in this moment... just survive.” Jamil’s advice is echoed by Dr Nikki Stamp, a cardiothoracic surgeon and author of Pretty Unhealthy: Why our obsession with looking healthy is making us sick. “The focus should not be on gaining or losing weight right now,” says Stamp. “What is probably more likely to be motivating is to focus on the benefits of healthy behaviours that don't have anything to do with appearance. “Thinking about the enjoyment aspect of exercise is far more likely to lead to us actually participating in behaviours that are good for our overall health.” Stamp says that food is comforting and there's nothing wrong with eating for enjoyment, especially in the high stress environment we're all in right now. But if food is our only coping mechanism we would benefit from looking for other ways to get some relief. “Mental health experts are recommending strategies such as keeping in contact with loved ones, gentle exercise, mindfulness or meditation practices and of course, talking through your problems if need be,” says Stamp. General practitioner Dr Mark McGrath says it’s important to keep our social isolation in perspective and remember that any weight gain is likely to be short-term. “While it's important not to dilute the main message of stay home and what to do if you become sick, my advice is that it's normal for body weight to fluctuate a little,” says McGrath. “Pay attention to your hunger signals, mostly eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full, but it's OK to eat for pleasure sometimes too. Make an occasion of meals and eat together with those in isolation with you.” To be clear, not obsessing about weight is not the same as not caring about your health. Mackintosh, who is the author of Thinsanity: 7 Steps to Transform Your Mindset and Say Goodbye to Dieting Forever, says that now more than ever, health is about balance. It’s about looking after our inner selves as well as our outer selves. “Of course, health is important,” says Mackintosh. “But you’re going to struggle if you try and press on with your health goals ignoring that we’re in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. Similarly, if you abandon all of your health goals and values, you’re probably not going to feel great either. “It’s important to cultivate some perspective. People are dying — people are losing their jobs. If all you get out of this is a couple of ‘corona kilos’, you’re probably pretty lucky.” The goal of any exercise should be about nurturing our physical and mental health, rather than punishing ourselves for not reaching a weight loss goal. Accredited practising dietitian and health coach Shivaun Conn says that we are all under so much stress and pressure right now it’s important to put the body shame and weight guilt on hold. “It’s detrimental to our mental health to feel guilty if we don’t work out every single day,” says Conn. “When we feel guilty about not performing our concept of what perfect health behaviours are, we may be saying to ourselves, ‘I did a bad thing, I’m not good enough, other people do better, why can’t I be as motivated as other people, what’s wrong with me?’. This can lead to a cascade of negative thinking that feeds into unhelpful beliefs about oneself.” Conn says that feelings of failure and inadequacy can decrease our motivation to start or continue with healthy behaviours. “These beliefs tend to feed thoughts such as, ‘there’s no point in trying or continuing with healthy behaviours as I will never succeed or be good enough’,” says Conn. So what should you do if you’ve been bingeing on Tim Tams and haven’t gotten off the couch for a couple of weeks and are now starting to worry about ""corona kilos""? “Feeling bad about what you did won’t change the past,” says Conn, adding that we are all doing our best to cope with the current situation. Conn suggests looking ahead and thinking about what you could do now or tomorrow to make yourself feel good and to look after yourself. “How can you move your body in a way that will be kind to it, feel good and look after it?” “How can you move your body in a way that will be kind to it, feel good and look after it?,” says Conn. “Just 30 minutes of moderate activity (such as a brisk walk) on most days, has been shown to be enough to support our immune system, as well as our mental and overall physical health.” At a time when people are losing their lives, losing their loved ones, losing their jobs, losing their communities, our losing weight is one more worry we can do without. We have heard many times that kindness is key to get us through this crisis. This includes kindness to ourselves. Rather than waging war with our bodies and loathing them for weight gain and other perceived imperfections, we should appreciate them for giving us the precious gift of life.

That and a belief that digital devices will always fail me when needed most. I doubled down early and raided the op shops, filling an entire backpack with a collection of DVD comedy gold, just in case, nay when, that internet-web-online thing suddenly decides to pack up shop. As we sit between our yesterday lives and an unknown future, it’s inevitable that nostalgia for yesteryear (or February) will catch us like B1 and B2, unawares and possibly wearing pyjamas for the third day straight. Remember scratching your nose? Good times. Early on I decided that reorganising the pantry would be the best way to press the pandemic pause button. A word of warning though, there will be agitators who just doesn’t ""get"" why soy sauce cannot be returned to the newly designated condiment shelf. It’s an art form family members will fail to appreciate. In quarantined conditions my partner’s found resolve and I’ve become aspirational. A year ago he dragged an old set of bar bells up the driveway and I scoffed, convinced he’d never use them. Turns out one man’s trash is another man’s home gym readily used during lockdowns. By the end of it all, I’m going to run my first marathon, because I’m sure all champions begin by jogging round the house a couple of times, before collapsing on the front steps begging for a gin and tonic to make the pain stop. Maybe now my partner and I would commit to learning the baroque recorder. Neighbours walking the dog will stop and listen: “hark, is that not a delightful rendition of Ich hort ein Sichlein rauschen emanating from number 59?” Though the rest of the world is off limits and globalisation may take a back seat for a while, finding our own satellite stations of domestic humour and humanity is a pretty good antidote against despair. Through my school mum WhatsApp group, I’ve shared mother-in-law memes from Germany, usually involving some sort of animal washing dishes in the sink, and received links to eccentric Twitter accounts like The Museum of English Rural Life, where a recent post reminds farm lads and lasses to avoid ""schoolboy errors"" like getting wedged between a new calved cow and her offspring. Thankyou @herdyshepherd1, your contribution to the let’s-get-through-this-together movement has been duly noted. Whether you’re mucking out or muddling through, let’s keep life safe and sensible. And maybe just a little bit silly too. Cath Moore.Credit:  Copyright © 2020", Cath Moore ,"April 18, 2020"

Well, now we can add “influenzors” because every self-isolator seems to have a vlog to flog. Of course, online motivating has been going on long before coronavirus came on the scene. The most famous “influencers” are Kourtney Kardashian, with her “home and lifestyle” website, Poosh, and Gwyneth Paltrow, whose “wellness and lifestyle” company, Goop, is promoting a candle that smells like her vagina. On Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop site, pleasure is presented in the context of wellness. Credit:Netflix When poosh comes to shove, I think I speak for most of the female population when I say: “WTF?”The plethora of online advice from celebrities is so confusing. Some suggest feasting on bone broth, others fasting. Should I be following paleo or Atkins or nibbling bio dynamic tofu? Should I be keen on kale or quinoa? Isn’t kale just cabbage with good PR? Should I be a helicopter mum or a tiger mum or a snowplough parent? Not only must I be a better parent/cake baker/male-pleasing fellatrix/career high-flyer with a couple of venture-capital portfolios tucked up each designer sleeve, but also thinner, prettier and exercising “mindfulness”. I bet Gwyneth and Kourtney are particularly “mindful” of how much money they’re making from other women’s insecurities. Clearly, it’s time I launched my own site. Rest assured, I have no desire to feng shui your aura at a vegan festival, or advise you to urinate in your own yurt because a mudslide has barred your exit flap. Nor will my website suggest you give half your salary to a self-styled intuitive heart healer who’ll awaken your inner warrior. No. My top tips are a tad more practical, as most ailments can be cured with a good laugh and a lamington. Mindfulness Making your mind go blank is best achieved by listening to the pseudo-scientific psychobabble of poncy “influencers”. Food fads Eat what makes you happy. I prefer food that’s been cooked in fat, showered in salt and coated in chocolate, preferably simultaneously. Yes, giving up bacon and beer might add two years to your life, but as all your beer-and-bacon-devouring pals will be dead already, who wants to live? How to be woke Drink an espresso martini. Facials Forget all about expensive deep-tissue Korean fruit detoxes. Why put avocado and yoghurt on your face when you could just eat it? The secret to good skin is to be Mediterranean. And the secret to beauty is to have Nordic parents who are prone to being tall and blonde and having ice-blue Viking eyes. Otherwise, just keep the lights low. (The dimmer switch – the greatest beauty aid to womankind.) Well-behaved childrenCelebrity mums suggest that we “tap into cuddle power” and be “dream-makers, not dream breakers.” I suggest a threat to cut pocket money to improve behaviour. Only in American sitcoms do mothers and daughters discuss the minutia of their lives with each other in funny, frank exchanges that always lead to hugging. Exercise Forget torturing yourself in triathlons. Just execute 20 or so sit-ups every morning, hitting the snooze button so you miss Pilates. Sex What does a woman really want in bed? Breakfast. I hope these “lifestyle” tips have increased your “wellness”. As for a candle that smells like my vagina? I’m going one better than Gwyneth. I’m going to promote a labial candelabra, or rather a candel-labia. Who wouldn’t wax lyrical about that!

I am amazed, in our first days of home schooling, at how fresh the emotional freight of education is: as if my long-ago feelings about the times tables (terrible) and Milly Molly Mandy (excellent) have all been perfectly preserved under the pack ice of increasing years, ready to be cracked free by the pick-axe of my own child. Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  During these first home-schooling days, I can feel my stomach muscles clenched with anxiety as the Primary Schooler completes her “Bridging to Ten” maths worksheets; my desperate focus on getting the mental maths answers correct (4 + 9 = … 13!). The Primary Schooler, conversely, has the attention span of a gnat, and a kind of sunny confidence unrelated to performance that I find both awe-inspiring and annoying.

Three: who knew her favourite number was four; or that she understood onomatopoeia; or that she’s obsessed with Irish dancing? I thought I knew her absolutely – the privilege of being a small child’s parent – yet here she is, already living a life beyond my influence. Irish dancing!

Primary schoolers fall rapturously into each other’s arms before we can stop them; mother and I discuss (at great distance and high volume) our worries about our own educational failures being horribly exposed: mother has just completed a shoelace-tying competition with her two children in which she came last.

On reflection, if it comes to choice of life skills – bridging to 10 or mixing a perfect drink – the answer is yes.   I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious. - Albert Einstein By the middle of week two, my new big worry is not educational but technological incompetence. Is the Primary Schooler’s learning being compromised because I’m not on top of social media? This seems insane, and yet the other day all her little mates were “bear hunting” around the neighbourhood – searching for teddy bears in people’s windows – and she was not, because I’m not on Facebook and didn’t know what the hell was going on.

The Irish dancing obsession continues: she’s somehow discovered that competitors glue their socks to their calves, which she finds mind-boggling (as do I, to be honest); she spends every spare moment leaping heavily around the sitting room with her arms clenched to her sides. This is, at least, proof of Einstein’s theory: an ounce of passionate curiosity outweighs a pound of rote learning. It’s clear she knows far more about the slip jig than the three times table. Meanwhile, back online, it’s also clear that home schooling – which, by definition, occurs at home, out of the public eye – has nonetheless become a whole new forum for competitive parenting. No sooner do you let your kid spend half an hour watching nit videos (broadly educational, right?) than you find someone, somewhere, recounting their virtual tour of MOMA with their five-year-old. The whole thing is utterly exhausting. All this, and work, too. (Remember work?) I find myself longing for some of this “unbearable-tedium-of-lockdown” I keep hearing about. I’m either teaching or working or feeling stricken with guilt; there is no tedium. 2130: Still trying to organise tomorrow. Have arranged Zoom violin lesson; pressed flowers for art project collage; cleaned up the detritus from “Will it Float, Sink or Dissolve?” science experiment.

You live and learn. Well, at any rate, you live. - Douglas Adams Week three begins with the Primary Schooler bouncing into the bedroom while I’m still asleep. “I’ve lost my knick!” she announces. “Your what?” I ask, rearing upright.“My knick. My knick of Irish dancing.” Later, I finally realise: there is a knack to worksheets. They are not intended as a proof of my child’s perfection, and therefore my own educational and maternal brilliance. They are a chance for her to learn. Am totally ashamed to say this comes as a revelation. And bizarrely, makes me far less worried about doing them.

Her: “Nice pair.” At dinner, she is utterly delighted – though mystified – to have made her father and me laugh. She sings, performs her patented wind-up clock dance, makes jokes, recites whole sections of Bluey by heart. She is happy, I realise, to have spent the day with us. It’s humbling to realise that your child’s favourite times are still the ones she spends with you. For some reason, COVID-19 has made this fact feel both more precious, and more fleeting. Next time something like this happens – if it ever does – she will be too big for this. Too big to be waiting for us, laughing with us, trying (not always, but often, and with a child’s good-hearted grace) to do what we ask. So maybe we should also try, at least in fleeting moments, to enjoy the horror while it lasts.

By Amanda Hooton Illustration by Simon Letch.Credit:  Education is an admirable thing. But it is well to remember, from time to time, that nothing worth knowing can be taught. - Oscar Wilde 0500 hours: The era of acronyms is upon us: our family’s first day of WFH (working from home) with CAH (child at home). My partner and I get up at 5am to get a head-start on (paid) work before child gets up. Start typing. 0520: Seven-year-old daughter, the Primary Schooler, is woken by the cat and gets up. Stop typing. 0525: Not the cat, as it turns out. Nits. Here’s another acronym: WTF. No work possible until 0900, when our school program, drafted on the kitchen table last night, takes effect. Spend intervening hours doing nit treatment, making school lunch in attempt to maintain order and routine (VIP, according to Google home-schooling advice), and attempting to create enticing classroom environment using Primary Schooler’s very low desk and tiny kid’s chairs.

Every star sign on love, career and more.Credit:iStock Taurus April 20-May 20 Feel as though you’re waiting to exhale? For those of you holding your breath, biting your tongue or biding your time the moment of truth has finally arrived. You can begin to tie up loose ends and clear away any karmic cobwebs enabling you to wipe the slate clean and giving you a sense of inner calm. Gemini May 21-June 21 The stars are bringing serendipity and opportunities making this a powerfully effective period that will give affirmations the extra dose of magic needed for success. Having said that, however, don’t wait for things to land in your lap and be proactive. Make calls, follow up leads and don't be shy about calling in a few favours. Cancer June 22-July 22 Home is always close to a Crab's heart, and while most are going stir crazy you'll be in your element giving your undivided attention to loved ones and any household. On the friend front though there'll be drama that doesn't directly involve you. You'll want to mediate or put your two cents worth in but stay out of it. Leo July 23-August 22 Penny pinching is an extravagant Feline’s worst nightmare! If you've been denying yourself and living lean of late that’s about to change. Lady Luck is shining on your bank balance enabling you to afford a creature comfort that's been out of reach. You've seen the results of what sensible spending achieves which will make you wiser with your money. Virgo August 23-September 22 I’m not going to insult your intelligence by sugarcoating it. You’re a perfectionist and control freak. You know what you want and usually have a military precision plan on how to achieve your goals. You work hard, play hard and leave little margin for error. However, an abundance of playful, spontaneous energy will encourage you to lighten and relax. Libra September 23-October 22 Your sector of creativity is lit up thanks to Mars giving you drive and Saturn enhancing your focus. Any sort of collaborations, but particularly pertaining to work, will greatly benefit from your artistic abilities and eye for detail. Any efforts towards fostering independence, originality and autonomy will show great promise and you’ll feel your confidence soar! Scorpio October 23 – November 22 If you’ve been penny pinching or afraid to look at price tags you’ll be able to relax a little more with money. Sweet Venus is shining upon your area associated with other people’s money. This placement is known for generating cash through other parties perhaps via a partner’s raise, a tidy sum from a parent, an inheritance or lottery win. Sagittarius November 23-December 20 If you’ve been working too hard or not making down time a priority, playful star placements encourage you to shift gears. If you don’t have a hobby it’s time to find an activity that floats your boat, preferably something you’ve always wanted to spend more time on. If you already have a passion, devote more time to it. Capricorn December 21-January 19 You’re usually pretty focussed but today you'll be at the top of your game. You'll be able to concentrate for longer periods of time, will have the clarity to find solutions to long standing problems and come up with some strokes of genius. You’ll also be more inclined to voice your opinions and put in your two cents worth. Aquarius January 20-February 18 Today you'll think about what you have and haven't achieved. Instead you should look at what you have accomplished and pat yourself on the back. Then ask why you haven't crossed others goals off your list. Perhaps you were unrealistic or didn't have a formula. Look at the areas in which you did succeed and employ those methods you used. Pisces February 19-March 20 Long term goals and patience are the key to your success. But if you're not happy with your current direction it's never too late to change. Do you really want to go on wondering what it would have been like or remain unsatisfied with what you're currently doing? All food for thought, just don't forget the action part.

Here's what you need to know","So, you’ve panic bought chickens for the shutdown! Congratulations and welcome to the chook loving community.  Chickens, as you’re finding out, are the complete package, supplying eggs and ""black gold"" (their nitrogen-rich and compostable poop), but also companionship, mental health benefits, entertainment, distraction for children and adults alike, and a capacity to destroy the garden which will take your breath away. Author Fiona Scott-Norman with her chickens Val and Dora.Credit:Ilana Rose They are also addictive, affectionate, and will cause your social media to light up the sky like a flame. Perfect for self-isolating. But chickens are complex. They’re not egg machines. They have needs. Here are some practical tips to fast track your journey. Remember: a contented chook is a productive chook. Firstly, keep your girls alive. Foxes are all through mainland Australian inner-city areas like pantry moths in last year’s bag of flour, and they love chicken. They live along train and creek lines, anywhere they can den. They’re ‘surplus killers’, active at dawn or dusk, but can visit any time to massacre your flock. Replay   Vigilance is key, and fox-proofing your sacred trust. Consider yourself Batman – I find this helps – and the fox is The Joker. Bury an apron of chicken wire around your run so the fox can’t dig under, and put up high, unclimbable walls. The coop needs a solid floor. Foxes will chew through soft wood coops and cheap wire. Useful tools are solar self-closing coop doors, fox lights, and the scent of a dog. Chickens are prey animals, so to feel safe they need sky cover; a bush or tree rather than open space. They also need to dust bath, sunbathe, eat a bit of greenery, and scratch around. The more space you give them to be chickens, the happier the flock, and the less violent the pecking order. The pecking order is real, and there’s always an excluded chook at the bottom. Your job is to sneak her extra treats. Very important. Try to avoid ‘Nugget’, ‘roast’ or ‘KFC’. A chicken’s job description includes turning leftovers into eggs, but human food scraps aren’t a proper diet (and avoid mouldy, rancid food. They’ll get sick). Leftovers are great for variety – and there’s nothing funnier than a chook sprinting with a strand of spaghetti in its beak – but modern chickens have been genetically turbo-charged and need a high protein diet. Buy proper balanced feed with a combination of grains and/or pellets. Chooks are omnivores, and appreciate any protein. They will absolutely eat chicken, but, come on, don’t do that. Chooks, er, poop a lot, including while they sleep, so clean the coop regularly (once a week minimum). Keep an eagle eye on their nesting boxes, because errant poo often ends up on the eggs, and can lead to salmonella and bacterial infection. Just brush the dirt off with a dry cloth or scourer. Eggs, which are porous, come out of the chook covered in a ""bloom"" which blocks bacteria, so if you wash eggs they’re more vulnerable to bacterial incursion. I know. Counter-intuitive. That said, plenty of people wash eggs, and shop-bought eggs are most definitely washed; just keep them in the fridge. Also, check the soil. Your chooks live to scratch around the undergrowth, eat insects and seeds, and ingest grit to aid their digestion. Yes, like toddlers, chickens unrepentantly eat dirt, so ideally your garden is not built on an industrial waste site, or contaminated with lead paint, dioxins, or organochlorine pesticide residue. Inner-city backyarders would be smart to research the history of land use in their area. Contaminants can affect your chooks ­– and you through the eggs. You can get a low-cost test for metals in your soil at Vegesafe. Don’t be surprised if you’re not getting eggs. Unless you’ve bought ISA browns, which can’t not lay, most breeds slow down production in autumn. It’s their cloacal holiday, taken because it’s colder, and there’s less daylight. They may be moulting, which is normal but looks alarming, like an explosion at a pillow factory. If you’ve bought young chickens they may not come into lay for weeks, and chooks stop laying if they’re stressed. Be kind, be patient, and learn the zen lesson; it’s not all about the eggs. The chicken must always come first. This Chicken Life by Fiona Scott-Norman & Ilana Rose, Published by Plum, RRP $32.99, photography by Ilana Rose.

You can get a low-cost test for metals in your soil at Vegesafe. Don’t be surprised if you’re not getting eggs. Unless you’ve bought ISA browns, which can’t not lay, most breeds slow down production in autumn. It’s their cloacal holiday, taken because it’s colder, and there’s less daylight. They may be moulting, which is normal but looks alarming, like an explosion at a pillow factory. If you’ve bought young chickens they may not come into lay for weeks, and chooks stop laying if they’re stressed. Be kind, be patient, and learn the zen lesson; it’s not all about the eggs. The chicken must always come first. This Chicken Life by Fiona Scott-Norman & Ilana Rose, Published by Plum, RRP $32.99, photography by Ilana Rose.

While Mackintosh and his team normally specialise in weight, exercise and body image, they made it clear that these sessions were to treat more general mental health concerns related to the pandemic rather than weight concerns. So Mackintosh was surprised by the requests that came back. Please stop worrying about ""corona kilos"".Credit:iStock “Even at a time like this, almost all of the people who responded still listed eating, weight and body image worries as their main concern.” With social media awash with “experts” peddling tips to avoid “corona kilos” you’d be forgiven for thinking that COVID-19 was a metabolic condition associated with excess weight gain rather than a deadly respiratory illness. As actress and activist Jameela Jamil posted after seeing “toxic influencers” ratcheting up people’s body image anxiety due to the changes in diet and exercise regimes, “Don’t worry about losing weight right now in this moment... just survive.” Jamil’s advice is echoed by Dr Nikki Stamp, a cardiothoracic surgeon and author of Pretty Unhealthy: Why our obsession with looking healthy is making us sick. “The focus should not be on gaining or losing weight right now,” says Stamp. “What is probably more likely to be motivating is to focus on the benefits of healthy behaviours that don't have anything to do with appearance. “Thinking about the enjoyment aspect of exercise is far more likely to lead to us actually participating in behaviours that are good for our overall health.” Stamp says that food is comforting and there's nothing wrong with eating for enjoyment, especially in the high stress environment we're all in right now. But if food is our only coping mechanism we would benefit from looking for other ways to get some relief. “Mental health experts are recommending strategies such as keeping in contact with loved ones, gentle exercise, mindfulness or meditation practices and of course, talking through your problems if need be,” says Stamp. General practitioner Dr Mark McGrath says it’s important to keep our social isolation in perspective and remember that any weight gain is likely to be short-term. “While it's important not to dilute the main message of stay home and what to do if you become sick, my advice is that it's normal for body weight to fluctuate a little,” says McGrath. “Pay attention to your hunger signals, mostly eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full, but it's OK to eat for pleasure sometimes too. Make an occasion of meals and eat together with those in isolation with you.” To be clear, not obsessing about weight is not the same as not caring about your health. Mackintosh, who is the author of Thinsanity: 7 Steps to Transform Your Mindset and Say Goodbye to Dieting Forever, says that now more than ever, health is about balance. It’s about looking after our inner selves as well as our outer selves. “Of course, health is important,” says Mackintosh. “But you’re going to struggle if you try and press on with your health goals ignoring that we’re in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. Similarly, if you abandon all of your health goals and values, you’re probably not going to feel great either. “It’s important to cultivate some perspective. People are dying — people are losing their jobs. If all you get out of this is a couple of ‘corona kilos’, you’re probably pretty lucky.” The goal of any exercise should be about nurturing our physical and mental health, rather than punishing ourselves for not reaching a weight loss goal. Accredited practising dietitian and health coach Shivaun Conn says that we are all under so much stress and pressure right now it’s important to put the body shame and weight guilt on hold. “It’s detrimental to our mental health to feel guilty if we don’t work out every single day,” says Conn. “When we feel guilty about not performing our concept of what perfect health behaviours are, we may be saying to ourselves, ‘I did a bad thing, I’m not good enough, other people do better, why can’t I be as motivated as other people, what’s wrong with me?’. This can lead to a cascade of negative thinking that feeds into unhelpful beliefs about oneself.” Conn says that feelings of failure and inadequacy can decrease our motivation to start or continue with healthy behaviours. “These beliefs tend to feed thoughts such as, ‘there’s no point in trying or continuing with healthy behaviours as I will never succeed or be good enough’,” says Conn. So what should you do if you’ve been bingeing on Tim Tams and haven’t gotten off the couch for a couple of weeks and are now starting to worry about ""corona kilos""? “Feeling bad about what you did won’t change the past,” says Conn, adding that we are all doing our best to cope with the current situation. Conn suggests looking ahead and thinking about what you could do now or tomorrow to make yourself feel good and to look after yourself. “How can you move your body in a way that will be kind to it, feel good and look after it?” “How can you move your body in a way that will be kind to it, feel good and look after it?,” says Conn. “Just 30 minutes of moderate activity (such as a brisk walk) on most days, has been shown to be enough to support our immune system, as well as our mental and overall physical health.” At a time when people are losing their lives, losing their loved ones, losing their jobs, losing their communities, our losing weight is one more worry we can do without. We have heard many times that kindness is key to get us through this crisis. This includes kindness to ourselves. Rather than waging war with our bodies and loathing them for weight gain and other perceived imperfections, we should appreciate them for giving us the precious gift of life.

The study, which involved a four-day-a-week exercise regimen, finds that among a generally healthy but sedentary group of adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s, working out lowers levels of depression, hostility and other negative feelings. The study also finds that the mood benefits of exercise can linger for weeks after people stop working out, offering another compelling reason for us to try to move, whenever and wherever we still can, during this coronavirus crisis. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between physical activity and lower levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and other bad moods.Credit:iStock There is plenty of evidence, of course, that physical activity affects mental health. In earlier studies, regular exercise substantially reduced risks for clinical depression among people with a genetic predisposition to the condition and helped to treat serious depression if it developed. Likewise, exercise often alleviates the severity of anxiety disorders, other research has shown. But those studies generally involved people with serious clinical conditions. In people without mood disorders, exercise research has been squishier. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between physical activity and lower levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and other bad moods. But those studies were observational, meaning they looked at people's lives and found links between regular exercise and buoyant moods. They cannot tell us whether the exercise actually caused people to feel cheerful and resilient, only that active people tend also to be relatively happy people. So for the new study, which was published in April in Health Psychology, researchers at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York City and at other institutions decided to mount one of the first experiments to test the effects of an exercise regimen on the mental health of generally healthy, although inactive, people. They hoped to see, in effect, whether people in generally good mental health – without a history of depression, anxiety or other mood disorders – could become even better adjusted and happier if they started to exercise. The scientists began by recruiting 119 sedentary adults age 20 to 45 without any known mental health problems. The scientists invited them to the lab, where they confirmed the state of their mental health with a series of questionnaires designed to measure people's current levels of depression, anxiety, hostility and anger. The researchers then randomly assigned the volunteers to two groups. One continued their normal lives and served as a control group. The others began exercising four times a week at the lab. Their exercise program was a standard moderate aerobic routine. They walked or jogged on treadmills or rode a stationary bicycle for about 35 minutes at a pace that left them somewhat breathless. (Technically, heart rates were raised to about 70 per cent to 80 per cent of each person's maximum.) This routine continued for three months. Then both groups of volunteers returned to the lab to repeat the mood questionnaires, and the members of the exercise group were asked to stop working out and resume their former inactivity for a month. Replay   ""Most of them didn't much want to quit,"" said Richard P. Sloan, a professor of behavioural medicine at Columbia who oversaw the new study. The exercising group had learnt to enjoy the exercise, he said. But they complied and avoided workouts for a month. Then everyone completed the mood questionnaires a final time, and the scientists checked for changes over the four months. As expected, they found that all 119 men and women had begun the experiment with sturdy mental health. Their scores showed them to be well-adjusted and jovial, with particularly low scores on anxiety. But the group that exercised had managed to bump down their already low numbers. After three months of working out, their overall scores on the depression scale fell by about 35 per cent, a significant difference from the control group, whose depression scores had barely budged. Hostility levels in the exercise group also plummeted. Declines in anxiety and anger were slighter, but the researchers think their volunteers began with such low levels of those feelings, they realistically could not fall much further. The mood improvements also lingered. Even after a month of inactivity, the former exercisers showed healthier scores for depression and hostility than the control group, although numbers were starting to return to where they had been at the start. Overall, the results suggest that ""exercise has real benefits for mood"", even if our moods are not dour or surly to start with, said Kathleen McIntyre, an instructor in psychiatric social work who led the study. The study did not examine how exercise might elevate our moods. But McIntyre speculated that the effects are likely to involve both physiology and psychology, with exercise altering various biological pathways related to affect and emotions, while also making exercisers feel more capable and empowered. The study also looked only at moderate aerobic exercise and involved only adults without any known disabilities or illnesses. But the findings still have obvious relevance now, when so many of us are feeling overwhelmed by the pandemic and its potential effects on our money, mortality, family, friends and futures. ""This study reminds us that we have this coping tool available to us,"" McIntyre said. ""If you can get outside and walk or hike or run safely, it should help with the negative feelings that just about everyone is experiencing right now."" And if outdoor activities seem unwise where you are, substitute online exercise classes, she said, or bounce around the living room with your children. ""Whatever physical activity you can manage is great,"" she said, and could help to lift your spirits, and those of everyone around you.

In late March, alcohol sales at bottle shops were up 37 per cent. James Atkinson isn't convinced by the health claims of alcohol companies. At the same time, promotion of so-called ‘healthy’ alcohol is on the rise. Beyond the low-sugar, low-carb options already on the market, a new, slicker range of ‘functional’ drinks are being targeted at the growing number of health-conscious consumers. Newly launched Impression Gin claims to be Australia’s first boutique gin made with vitamin C and “collagen-rich botanicals”. Sour beers, which get their tart taste from the health-promoting live probiotics they contain, like Lactobacillus (typically found in yoghurt), are said to be healthier beers. The appeal of boozy kombuchas with their array of bacteria, “beneficial acids” and healthy flavours like turmeric, lies in the supposed array of health benefits to be found in their non-alcoholic sibling. There is also organic spirulina sparkling vodka and cocktails containing chia seeds, bee pollen or activated charcoal. But, are these so-called 'healthy' alcohols any better for us? Can we really get tipsy and benefit our health at the same time, or is it too good to be true? Boozy kombuchas and sours are “much lower in sugar” than other forms of alcoholic beverages, says James Atkinson, host of podcast Drinks Adventures, but whether there are other benefits remains unknown. “In sour beers, the lactobacillus is used to consume sugars along with the yeast, so how much of that is left in the beer... I don’t know,” Atkinson says. Accredited practising dietitian, Dr Joanna McMillan says most micro-organisms don’t like alcohol. “While they may have found a species to survive in the beer, is this really the best medium for it? I don’t think a live bacteria in a beer makes it healthier,” McMillan says. “Sounds like cashing in on the probiotic fermentation trend to me.” Cancer Council WA’s Alcohol Program Manager, Julia Stafford, believes it is marketing spin with no substance. “Alcohol companies are trying to put a health halo on products that are fundamentally unhealthy,” Stafford says. “It’s the alcohol within alcohol products that’s the main risk to health. Many of these so-called ‘better for you’ products contain as much alcohol as other products so they carry all the risks associated with the alcohol component.” Regardless of the claims, the healthiest choice any of us can make is to reduce our drinking, she says. “Unfortunately, alcohol marketing is largely self-regulated by the alcohol and advertising industries. The advertising codes are too narrow and weak to restrict health claims in alcohol ads.” Peter Miller, a professor of psychology at Deakin University and an expert in addiction, says the industry is “green-washing” alcohol. “Whatever that active ingredient is... the notion that there can be some sort of health offset, we don’t have that evidence. It’s very unlikely it’s going to ameliorate the negative impact of alcohol.” That said, he added: “At a very small level, the National Health and Medical Research Council says less than two drinks per day or four on any one occasion... can serve to release a little bit of tension. “If you’re going to have a couple of drinks, drink what you want rather than just making your wee expensive. We need to make sure people aren’t falling for that sort of spin. “On the other hand, if you like kombucha... I would say, just remember the NHMRC guidelines and, in these times, find other ways to deal with your stress. If you’re only using alcohol to try and deal with the symptom of your stress, that’s going to lead to its own problems.” Replay   Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

I don’t think a live bacteria in a beer makes it healthier,” McMillan says. “Sounds like cashing in on the probiotic fermentation trend to me.” Cancer Council WA’s Alcohol Program Manager, Julia Stafford, believes it is marketing spin with no substance. “Alcohol companies are trying to put a health halo on products that are fundamentally unhealthy,” Stafford says. “It’s the alcohol within alcohol products that’s the main risk to health. Many of these so-called ‘better for you’ products contain as much alcohol as other products so they carry all the risks associated with the alcohol component.” Regardless of the claims, the healthiest choice any of us can make is to reduce our drinking, she says. “Unfortunately, alcohol marketing is largely self-regulated by the alcohol and advertising industries. The advertising codes are too narrow and weak to restrict health claims in alcohol ads.” Peter Miller, a professor of psychology at Deakin University and an expert in addiction, says the industry is “green-washing” alcohol. “Whatever that active ingredient is... the notion that there can be some sort of health offset, we don’t have that evidence. It’s very unlikely it’s going to ameliorate the negative impact of alcohol.” That said, he added: “At a very small level, the National Health and Medical Research Council says less than two drinks per day or four on any one occasion... can serve to release a little bit of tension. “If you’re going to have a couple of drinks, drink what you want rather than just making your wee expensive. We need to make sure people aren’t falling for that sort of spin. “On the other hand, if you like kombucha... I would say, just remember the NHMRC guidelines and, in these times, find other ways to deal with your stress. If you’re only using alcohol to try and deal with the symptom of your stress, that’s going to lead to its own problems.” Replay   Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

It was a sensible decision, but a small part of me began to worry. Looming on the other side of this pandemic was my (postponed) wedding, so despite being sent indoors, I wanted to maintain a workout routine. Which is how I found myself pacing the aisles of Big W, panic purchasing anything that seemed remotely fitness related. The result was a hilariously mismatched setup. But it turns out my panic was not only a waste of money but a waste of time. Fitness trainer Jeremy Tunkunas using some of his home equipment.Credit:Edwina Pickles When it comes to setting up a functional home gym, less is more, according to personal trainer Jeremy Tunkunas, director of Body Fit Training. “Forget the bells and whistles and pick versatile equipment that focuses on strength and full-body workouts,” Tunkunas says. “You don’t need to spend a fortune to stay fit and healthy at home.” (So glad I kept the receipt for that Vibrating Power Plate.) With self-isolation the new normal for the foreseeable future, Tunkunas was kind enough to share his top four at-home gym essentials to keep you on track. Replay   With gym equipment overtaking toilet paper in the hoarding hierarchy, resistance bands are Tunkunas’ pick for both functionality and availability. “They’re cheap, should be easy to track down and will offer a variety of different options for a self-isolated session, perfect for in-house glute, leg and arm workouts,” he says. “The most important thing I use them for though is stretching before and after a workout. They’re so helpful in getting that full range, so your muscles are properly warmed up.” DIY alternative: Old tights or stockings. Anything with a bit of elasticity should do the trick. “Dumbbells can pretty much be used or any lift-based exercise,” Tunkunas says. “For your home gym, I recommend an adjustable set that you can add or remove weight to as needed.” If you’re keen to sweat, start light and opt for high intensity exercises like dumbbell punches, shoulder raises or incline press. And when you’re looking to add bulk, pump up the weight. “Heavier dumbbells are good for compound exercises, which engage different muscle groups so we’re talking squats, dumbbell deadlifts and weighted lunges,” Tunkunas explains. DIY alternative: Fill two water bottles with sand and you’ve got a DIY-dumbell. Canned vegetables also make a good substitute. “The kitchen chair offers a little bit of everything,” Tunkunas says. “You can use it for step-ups, box jumps or tricep dips or as a bench during weight workouts. If you can, try to pick a chair that is the same width as your shoulders so you can keep all your exercises sturdy and square.”  Because of their odd design, kettlebells engage your core muscles which make them the perfect equipment to hit as many muscle groups at once. “Try kettlebell swings or a classic clean and press for a solid full body workout,” Tunkunas says. “[And] you can use the kettlebell for Pilates-based mat routines, which will tighten and tone your core. Plus they can be packed away easily once you’re done.” DIY alternative: Laundry detergent bottles are usually bottom-heavy making it the perfect pretend kettlebell.

29,/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/follow-these-basic-principles-for-a-good-workstation-20200417-p54kow.html,Follow these basic principles for a good workstation,"At its most luxurious, the home office is a subsidiary of leisure space: a sun-drenched room in a second home from which the boss can check in on everyone back at the office. In its more utilitarian form, it is, at least, personalised and private. There's a chair, a desk and, ideally, a door. There's probably other stuff in there too, like filing cabinets and unseasonal clothes and a guest bed. But it's a place to work. Your whole entire posture is going to be related to where your monitor is.Credit:iStock According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 29 per cent of wage and salary workers could work at home in some capacity in 2017, while 25 per cent actually did so. Now, however, workers with home offices are spending more time in them than ever intended. Plenty more are simply working from home however and wherever possible: at the table; at the counter; in bed; on the couch; in the garage. Most workplaces aren't ready for this. Most living spaces aren't either. Yet millions of us have been sent home and may be there for a while. Perhaps you are one of them. Whether you are working, avoiding work, balancing work with care for others or looking for work, chances are your temporary office is neither an optimised nor particularly happy place right now. I have no tips for optimising it, in the aspirational work-from-home, escape-the-office sense. Let's lower our expectations. Here are a few ways to make working from home less miserable, according to experts. Karen Loesing, a certified ergonomics assessment specialist, helps people design their workspaces for maximum comfort and productivity. She can tell you what to buy and how to set it up. But right now you may not want, or be able, to buy new things. According to Loesing, much of the standard equipment on the market leaves something to be desired anyway. ""The average desk for years has been at around 74 centimetres, and that fits hardly anybody in a correct posture,"" she said. (Most people end up with a desk surface that's too high.) Wherever you're able to sit, there are some basic principles to keep in mind, Loesing said. Your hands should be on your keyboard, with your forearms basically flat and elbows bent at a right angle. Your back should be supported (""If you're not sitting at the back of the chair for support, it's like you're holding a weight all day long,"" she said) and slightly reclined — around 15 degrees from straight. Your feet should be resting on the ground, with your knees bent as close to 90 degrees as possible. This may not be easy at the kitchen table in a wooden chair, so do what you can with pillows, boxes, plastic storage containers or books. ""Don't sit on a stabilisation ball,"" Loesing said. ""Those are for gyms."" Then there's your screen. ""Your whole entire posture is going to be related to where your monitor is,"" Loesing said. If your monitor is too low, you'll slump forward and, sooner or later, be in pain. ""If you're looking straight ahead, you want to be about 10 centimetres below the top of screen,"" she said. If your monitor is too low, you'll slump forward and, sooner or later, be in pain. To achieve this setup, place your laptop on a stack of books and connect a keyboard, which should sit on your work surface. (External keyboards are still widely available and affordable if you must order one.) If your work involves papers, note that commercial document holders are intended to sit between your keyboard and screen. You can use a clipboard or a thin book leaned against the bottom of an external monitor to create this effect. (If you have access to an external display — and don't discount using your television for this, whether over Wi-Fi, with a feature like Apple AirPlay, or by using a cable — you can turn your laptop's screen into a document holder.) Loesing said that many of her clients are enthusiastic about switching to standing desks. ""They've read all this material about how sitting is the new smoking,"" she said. ""They're excited. It's a novelty."" Do it if you want — the same guidelines for your monitor and arms apply, although you should be careful when stacking boxes to get your laptop 5 or 6 feet off the ground — but don't expect to stand all day. Maybe 20 per cent or 30 per cent of the time, Loesing said. Try not to lock your knees. Throw a book on the floor to lift up one foot at a time — this can help ward off discomfort and keep you aware of your posture. Replay   You may be surprised at how quickly standing in place becomes uncomfortable. Walking for hours may feel fine; the discomfort of standing in place, even for much shorter times, can sneak up on you. When your workspace stops feeling good, the best thing you can do, Loesing said, is move around. Take breaks. Sit somewhere else for a few minutes. Look out the window frequently, and remind yourself that this won't go on forever. Real offices are designed according to all sorts of theories and principles: correct values for density, plans for lighting and acoustics, flow. The emergency home office, in contrast, was most likely designed for something else: eating, sleeping or storage. George Evageliou, president of Urban Homecraft, a custom furniture company, suggests taking a moment to visualise the office you want, even if it's out of reach. ""Look for the ideal, understanding that you're not going to get it,"" said Evageliou, who is currently locked down in a 250-square-foot studio apartment. ""Whatever you get is going to be better for it."" This exercise, in the moment, may feel extreme. Ideal: an office with a door, a space to work, a clearer line between the stresses of home and the stresses related to work. Improved reality: a table in a kitchen or living room, cleared off, where nothing can happen but work. If space is your problem, that's fine. ""Try to create delineations within a room,"" Evageliou said. (He spoke to me from a desk installed underneath a lofted bed.) A clear workspace of any sort — a few square feet surrounded by an invisible fence — can help maintain mental boundaries, too. Knowing that you're not redesigning your home, or signing up to do this forever, can recast otherwise less-than-appealing prospects as reasonable concessions to a need for privacy, space and emotional separation. ""A closet is an ideal place for a desk,"" Evageliou said. Yes, it's a closet. But it's also, he said, ""a great spot to eliminate distractions and focus."" Having a truly separate space in which to work, no matter how small, can pay off in other ways. ""It makes it much more pleasurable to return to the dinner table, or to sit down on the couch and watch TV,"" Evageliou said. Maybe most of your home has become a borderless, chaotic work/child care/storage/food preparation zone. A tiny quadrant for thinking and dealing with the outside world will help. So can its inverse: Pick a truly work-free space, even if it's just your bed, and keep it sacred.

It has ballooned to cartoon size as a consequence of International Women's Day on Sunday, and all the companies and individuals cynically capitalising on an all-important date put in place to advocate for equality and stamp out the obstacles still standing in women's way. And it will no doubt continue to balloon further for the remainder of what has now been rebranded ""International Women's Month"", with every social media post and email newsletter cementing my sense of self-worth - and a renewed gush of praise and celebration expected on Mothering Sunday. What have I done to deserve all this praise and celebration? I was born female. And I don't want to play down the importance of either my sex or the March 8 date, officially recognised as International Women's Day in 1977 by the United Nations. Let's not forget that it was on that day in 1917 that members of the women's movement in Russia decided to peacefully protest against the war, and exactly a year later that women across Europe held rallies in solidarity. Following the Second World War, countries from all continents began using March 8 as a marker for advocating women's rights, and in the '70s hundreds of women marched for abortion rights and workplace equality across the US. I say ""let's not forget"", because we are starting to, aren't we? Drunk on empty hashtagged empowerment, we're bastardising a concept that needs to be kept lofty, altruistic and focused on one simple and unsexy message: men need to stop killing, raping, maiming and harassing women. Also, we'd like equal rights and pay, please. But that message has been buried by the craven consumers bombarding my inbox with implorations to ""empower women's individuality through style"", ""make your shopping count"", and ""help women to support women"" by clicking ""buy now"" on that super wide-leg jumpsuit, as well as ""a selection of girly products perfect for your little ones from flowery Dolce & Gabbana dresses and Monnalisa accessories to Gucci belt bags"". They're reducing women's rights to a marketing ploy. And yes, I'm sure that a percentage of the ""proceeds from the Empower Her collection"" being flogged by a sporting goods company will benefit a foundation supporting ""girls' running programmes"", just as I'm sure that the homeware brand peddling ""Bhutan Cloud Pillows"" are supporting ""empowered female artisans in Mombasa""... but more than anything these gruesome bandwagon-jumpers are using feminism to line their own coffers. They're reducing women's rights to a marketing ploy. It's not just companies revelling in such Hallmark-hollow branding exercises, but individuals. Because in our social media age we're all brands. Which is why women hawking their latest projects (and themselves) on Twitter and Instagram have eagerly appropriated #HeForShe and #WeRiseByLiftingOthers, presumably because the honest versions of those hashtags - #MeForMe and #IRiseByPretendingToLiftOthers - wouldn't be so well received. Then there are the men. Oh, there's a special place in hell for men using a platform for female equality to further their own ends. Take the Father of Daughters blogger and Instagrammer, Simon Hooper, who decided to make a State of the Union-like Instagram address to ""all the incredible women that have been there to guide me"", and ""encourage and empower"" them ""to achieve their goals and be what they want to be"" - before shamelessly plugging the insurance firm sponsoring him. Even Sadiq Khan, London's Mayor, who I like, went a bit too far with the IWD virtue-signalling, tweeting: ""Believe women. Respect women. Promote women. Trust women."" What, all women? Because when any concentrated concept or campaign becomes an amorphous love-in, this is the problem we run into. Women are not all honest or trustworthy, and they certainly shouldn't be promoted above men simply by virtue of their sex. They are not a uniquely superlative breed or a non-competitive community, deserving of celebration and flowers for the rest of ""International Women's Month"", but individuals who are themselves capable of evil and misogyny - yet nevertheless deserve to feel safe and have equal rights.

Take the Father of Daughters blogger and Instagrammer, Simon Hooper, who decided to make a State of the Union-like Instagram address to ""all the incredible women that have been there to guide me"", and ""encourage and empower"" them ""to achieve their goals and be what they want to be"" - before shamelessly plugging the insurance firm sponsoring him. Even Sadiq Khan, London's Mayor, who I like, went a bit too far with the IWD virtue-signalling, tweeting: ""Believe women. Respect women. Promote women. Trust women."" What, all women? Because when any concentrated concept or campaign becomes an amorphous love-in, this is the problem we run into. Women are not all honest or trustworthy, and they certainly shouldn't be promoted above men simply by virtue of their sex. They are not a uniquely superlative breed or a non-competitive community, deserving of celebration and flowers for the rest of ""International Women's Month"", but individuals who are themselves capable of evil and misogyny - yet nevertheless deserve to feel safe and have equal rights.

Annabelle Williams is a former Paralympian who now works as an international speaker educating companies on the importance of gender diversity.Credit:James Brickwood But she did wind up back in the pool, going on to break five world records and win gold for Australia at the 2012 London Paralympics. The 31-year-old, also an Order of Australia recipient, lawyer and TV commentator, still loves to talk. And she is now using her voice to spread the message on gender equality and diversity to audiences globally. This week, to mark International Women’s Day on Sunday, Williams flew from Sydney to Saudi Arabia, to present to hundreds of people at massive petrol and gas company, Saudi Aramco. Saudi Arabia might not seem an obvious fit to celebrate women’s equality, given the country only granted women the right to drive in 2018. And it wasn’t until last year that women were able to apply for a passport without a male guardian’s permission. Williams met several Aramco executives while studying an executive MBA at Stanford University last year, and says the speaking gig comes during a time of change in the Kingdom. “The people I’ve spoken to from the company are really keen to push the needle forward on gender equality and equality in general,” she says. “I also am aware that when I’m speaking to those topics ... it’s usually to diversity inclusion officers or managers, so they’re already big believers. I thought this would be a good opportunity to be involved in an initiative where they are trying to be the drivers of change.” In the past six months, Williams has spoken about diversity and inclusion at companies including Qantas, Citibank and P&O Cruises. [They] are really keen to push the needle forward on gender equality. She believes most Australian companies are taking positive steps toward gender equality. “Having said that, we are still a long way from true equality,” she says. “The gender pay gap is still real. Most workplaces don’t have breastfeeding rooms. Childcare is too expensive.” Williams says society must recognise that gender diversity has wide-ranging benefits, “economically, socially and politically”. Williams was inspired to take to become a speaker after delivering a well-received speech during her six-week executive MBA. Not one to mess about, Williams, mum to 18-month old daughter Josie, completed the course during maternity leave. “I thought I’m going to have a whole year off; I may as well do something productive,” she says. “But when I had her, I thought oh my God. I felt so conflicted. I had to stop breastfeeding the morning I started the executive MBA. “The only reason I could do it was because of the amount of support I had from my husband and my parents, who all came with me.” Prior to that, Williams worked as legal counsel for the Australian Olympic Committee. She’s still vice-president of Paralympics Australia. I felt a need ... to prove to people that one hand wasn't going to be a limitation. While her speaking venture involves plenty of international travel, it also gives her more time with Josie – who she sometimes takes along for the ride. Williams, born without a left hand and forearm, believes having a disability has made her extremely ambitious. “I think I felt a need, particularly when I was young, to prove to people that one hand wasn’t going to be a limitation for me,” she says. That included devising her own approach to everyday tasks, such as using a zipper, plaiting her hair or peeling a potato. “Over time all these little things make you quite determined. You just don’t allow roadblocks to stop you – you sort of bulldoze on through.” After receiving so much support during her life, Williams now wants to give back and inspire others. “If there’s a little girl out there with one arm who feels like maybe she can’t play netball because people will wonder or not whether she can catch the ball, well I was in that position,” she says. And since having her daughter, Williams has another reason to keep fighting the good fight. “If I can help to drive a change so that she grows up in a society where there is more gender equality and more equal rights for everyone, that’s absolutely what I want to do.” Larissa is a reporter and producer Copyright © 2020", Larissa Ham ,"March 8, 2020"

The headcount is telling: of 104 leaders, 101 are men, three are women. Over 177 years, women have led this city for a grand total of four years. I’m ashamed to admit I’d never heard of Lecki Ord or Winsome McCaughey, our first 2 female Lord Mayors in 1987 and ’88 respectively. Why didn’t I know their names or stories? I invited them to Town Hall to find out more. Lord mayor Sally Capp.Credit:Simon Schluter These two women were pivotal in modernising Melbourne at the time when our city was suffering from a population and excitement deficit in the mid-1980s. Lecki and Winsome helped implement Postcode 3000, a policy to entice people back to the centre. They transformed our city. Now we are vibrant, exciting, industrious – attracting residents from all over the world. Within the decade we’ll be Australia’s biggest city. Their vision and leadership should be celebrated, but unless we tell their story and mention their names, Lecki Ord and Winsome McCaughey’s legacy is invisible. It is lost. I wondered what other wonderful women were missing from our collective memory. A head count of statues and monuments around the city of Melbourne gives us 23 men. There are only two women, one is Queen Victoria. On Swanston Street alone, we’ve got Matthew Flinders, Burke and Wills, Sir Redmond Barry and a bronze dog named Larry LaTrobe. So where are the women? Did they sit idly chatting about the weather as men built the city? Unfortunately, women have been discounted or erased as city-shaping leaders in our story. Leckie Ord (left) was Melbourne's first female lord mayor. Winsome McCaughey (right) followed straight after. Pictured in 2016 with the Greens' Olivia Ball (centre). Credit:Eddie Jim From the 1850s gold rush, Melbourne was a city of pubs and inns. As historian Professor Clare Wright has unearthed, at least 50 per cent of hotels were owned by or licensed to women. Authorities believed they would run “a more orderly house” and have a calming effect on drunken patrons. It was a golden opportunity to get ahead for widows, deserted wives and working class women without an education. Running a business, in any era, requires grit. Food, beer, wine and lodgings – it was rough and ready but these women created the foundation for Melbourne’s modern hospitality industry. How about a monument, a mural, a painting? These enterprising ladies should be remembered. Another city-shaping Melburnian is Vida Goldstein. Not long after Australia became a nation in 1901, our young country was big news across the world when all adult Australian white women won the right to vote and – more shocking - the right to stand for election. Vida was the driving force behind that hard-won change. She was revered internationally as the leader of the “votes for women” movement and was among the first four women to stand for federal Parliament. She fired up national debate about wage equality, the right to be safe from violence in the home and women taking their place in the political arena. Either Vida was ahead of her time or we’re taking too long to make change. She died in 1949, without recognition. A global sensation in her day, this woman needs her story up in lights. Do we know of Lady Gladys Nicholls, one of our leading Aboriginal activists? From the 1940s to the 1970s, her community work around the inner city, especially caring for young, destitute Aboriginal girls was legendary. Lady Gladys at least has a statue, our only local woman. Arm-in-arm she stands in bronze with her husband in the Parliament Gardens. She was cherished by the community. Our Aboriginal women were not even counted as citizens until 1967. They have faced systemic disadvantage on a crushing scale. Are we a good city for them yet? Where are their stories? Zelda D’Aprano was another change-maker. At 40, Zelda had held a range of jobs where she’d been paid a fraction of her male co-workers’ salary. In every job she’d asked for equal pay and was sacked more than once for her impertinence. In 1969, the Court of Arbitration was hearing an Equal Pay test case brought by Zelda’s employer, the Meatworkers Union. Technically, the case succeeded: the court ruled that equal pay would apply where a woman was doing exactly the same work as a man. It was the hollowest of victories. In the meat industry, as in most industries, there were no or very few women doing exactly the same work as men. Qualified women were relegated to support roles and, infamously, in the public service required to resign upon pregnancy. Zelda, fed up, chained herself to the doors of the Commonwealth Building in protest. She said, “I was convinced that genteel meetings at the city square would never achieve anything. Women would have to fight for what they wanted.” Her radical stand made the news, the union sacked her for being too outspoken and she went on to lead many other protests against bone-headed unfairness. Her gutsy effort deserves recognition. Tayla Harris poses with her statue in Federation Square.Credit:AAP You might think statues are rather quaint, a place for birds to do their business, but monuments, plaques and pictures in public spaces are important, because storytelling is important. Social researchers tell us that visual representations of trailblazers influence the collective psyche of a community. They single out which people and events matter. They signify authority, reverence, credibility and gravitas. The more women and their deeds are seen publicly, the more respect they receive. The AFLW gives us a modern Melbourne story that includes all women. And there’s already a prototype statue – Tayla Harris kicking sky high in Federation Square, kicking sexism out of the park. Vida, Lady Gladys, Zelda, Lecki, Winsome and Tayla: thank you for being bold, radical, unflinching and determined.

In a unanimous decision all seven High Court judges found Victoria's Court of Appeal should not have upheld Pell's conviction It found the evidence could not support a guilty verdict. So it’s International Women’s Day on Sunday and, like most years, as a feminist who writes a regular social commentary column in this publication, I’ve been asked to speak at various events observing the day. This would normally all be fine. I could repeat the same concerns I’ve been expressing passionately for years - the epidemic of domestic violence, wage inequality, inadequate childcare, male privilege, where to after #metoo … Bettina Arndt has lashed calls for her Order of Australia to be rescinded. Credit:Joshua Morris But this year I proffered a new topic for discussion. And considering the sputtering and choking noises through the phone at its mention, it’s one that women may not want to hear. But here goes anyway because I believe this needs to be said – we are not perfect. Yep, you read right. I am dubious of feminism painting women within the confines of suffragette and saint, no deviation allowed. This continuous narrative of male bad, female good, is too broadstroke. And, if we are really honest, it’s also not helping. Now, that sound you heard is women taking to social media to condemn me for betraying my gender, to insult me for daring to go against the grain of what certain hardliners decree. However, I will cop the abuse for the greater good, even though the backlash, I know from experience, is brutal. Going off-piste today when discussing feminism is to literally wear a bullseye as a third eye. In the past, I have deviated from doctrine, daring to suggest in writing that men can and should refer to themselves as feminists, receiving the nastiest, personal bile as a result, one fellow writer going as far to call me a ""traitorous c---"". So much for that sisterhood. And that was nothing compared to when I opined that certain religious or pro-life women should not be excluded from feminism for their beliefs, that the movement should be accommodating not alienating. Let’s get one thing out of the way here before I continue – I am no Bettina Arndt. In fact, I would say the only thing the self-proclaimed men's rights activist and I have in common is that neither of us has been a registered psychologist. The columnist deserves to be honoured with an Order of Australia about as much as does convicted paedophile George Pell. However, I do believe that there is a middle ground that must be explored and celebrated by women, shades of grey that allow debate and free thought. An argument here to illustrate my point: yes, women do falsely accuse men of domestic assault or harming children in custody cases as post #MeToo investigations have shown. And yes, this is a tiny fraction that I agree gets way too much attention amid the bigger and imperative issue of valid sexual assaults against women. But I will not cop the hard-line feminist argument that this doesn’t happen at all or there is “no evidence” to support such claims, that it's false news perpetuated by the patriarchy. Come on, ladies - we must grip the fact that we, too, can err. One Nation senator Pauline Hanson, whose views I respect about as much as Arndt’s, recently expressed concern that some women were making up domestic violence claims in custody battles, which should be addressed in the Coalition's impending investigation into the family law system. “I am hearing too many cases where parents are using domestic violence to stop the other parent from seeing their children,” she told the ABC. Predictably, Hanson copped a pile-on. And again, I agree that instances of women abusing the system are miniscule in comparison to the epidemic of men abusing and endangering partners and children. However, I refuse to insist they never happen at all to fall in line with what some believe it takes to be a ""true feminist"". I know they happen – albeit rarely – because women are human, too. I also have witnessed such an incident within my own friendship group. However, for the past 18 months, I have also watched as one of my girlfriends has been abused, hounded and defamed by her ex to the point where I have gravely feared for her safety. And the last thing I want to do is re-abuse any victim. What I do want to do is open up a discussion that appears currently closed, one that may help men understand their actions to help stop them. I want change and I don’t see it likely to happen when feminist doctrine is demonising men as unalterable. We need to sometimes step down from the unchallenged higher ground. I believe that a black and white perception that centuries of suppression has made women superior or saintly is not helping. We need to embrace a moderate middle if parity is ever to be achieved. We need to say that, yes, the patriarchy still exists and it's evil. Yes, men must be stopped from abusing and killing women – by any means it takes and NOW! And yes, I will continue to fight with all the passion I can muster to keep women safe - for reproductive rights, pay equity, quotas … I will remain defiantly feminist until the word is rendered redundant, replaced with humanism. But surely the fight for equality – which is and shall always be my feminist goal – shouldn’t mean we repeat history and try to repress another gender or that we have no need for further introspection? Let’s not make this literally tit for tat. How about we proudly celebrate International Women’s Day for what we really are – fierce, fabulous and flawed, too. Wendy Squires is a regular columnist.

I believe that a black and white perception that centuries of suppression has made women superior or saintly is not helping. We need to embrace a moderate middle if parity is ever to be achieved. We need to say that, yes, the patriarchy still exists and it's evil. Yes, men must be stopped from abusing and killing women – by any means it takes and NOW! And yes, I will continue to fight with all the passion I can muster to keep women safe - for reproductive rights, pay equity, quotas … I will remain defiantly feminist until the word is rendered redundant, replaced with humanism. But surely the fight for equality – which is and shall always be my feminist goal – shouldn’t mean we repeat history and try to repress another gender or that we have no need for further introspection? Let’s not make this literally tit for tat. How about we proudly celebrate International Women’s Day for what we really are – fierce, fabulous and flawed, too. Wendy Squires is a regular columnist.

I'm not suggesting Her Majesty wouldn't prefer curling up with a copy of Horse & Hound over an issue of Vogue, but no one can look as immaculately turned out as she has, successfully negotiating her way through 90 years of potential sartorial landmines, without acquiring an impressive knowledge and appreciation of cut, colour and silhouette, as well as a thorough understanding of the potency of genuine style. She possesses far too many made-to-measure outfits, much too distinctive a personal style (what is now popularly called A Signature Look) and has conducted far too many genuinely ""out there"" experiments in colour and headwear for us to believe she doesn't find the process of Dressing The Part diverting. The Queen wore bright pink for a visit to Queensland in 2002. The notion that the young Queen Elizabeth II was somehow too wholesome to care about frocks was part of a deliberate policy on the part of her parents. When they reluctantly ascended to their thrones in 1938, George VI and Elizabeth deliberately distanced themselves from anything that smacked of metropolitan modishness, partly through natural inclination, partly to portray themselves as the antithesis of the immaculately dressed abdicator Edward VIII and his brittle but oh so chic American wife Wallis Simpson, whose well-documented obsession with style was viewed as distinctly ""un-British"". The idea that the Queen isn't interested in clothes has always struck me as off the mark. Positioning themselves as the quintessential British family – fond of dogs, horses and wary of anything that might be deemed pretentious – involved judicious image tweaking. For George VI's and Queen Elizabeth's first official royal visit to Paris in 1938, deemed vitally important in shoring up Anglo-French relations in the face of growing German aggression, Queen Elizabeth (dismissed as a dumpy frump by Wallis) commissioned Norman Hartnell to whisk her up a confection of frothy gowns that accentuated her English Rose charm. Today this would be called branding. The young Royal family focused on duty, empathy and a charming lack of sophistication. ""Now I can look the East End in the eye,"" the Queen Mother famously said after Buckingham Palace had been bombed – notwithstanding the fact that the royal bomb shelter contained antique furniture and old masters. This diligence, together with the years of rationing and austerity that followed the war, helped cement a national suspicion that an overt interest in appearance or image was somehow a bit ""off"". Elizabeth, the Queen Mother celebrates her 80th birthday in the company of her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen has evidently cultivated her own appearance and image over the years. She might not lay it on as thickly as her predecessor Elizabeth I, with her white skin paint and red wigs, but our current monarch uses clothes to bolster her status as both the world's foremost head of state, and a woman firmly rooted in the British countryside. Witness her impeccable country attire, or the razzle-dazzle evening wear that has impressed many a visiting state dignitary, including a certain New York-born president with a weakness for over-the-top gilding. Replay   The reaction following the Queen's televised speech a fortnight ago – only the fifth time she has addressed the nation outside her annual Christmas appearance – shows just how deftly she uses sartorial props to amplify her words. The sight of this 93-year-old WFH (or in her case working from a castle), beautifully groomed in a vivid green dress, pearl necklace and Queen Mary's diamond and turquoise brooch that dates back to 1893, represented a beacon of continuity at a moment when the country was reeling from a succession of societal, economic and health quakes. To watch this woman, who had lived through the Second World War, speaking so stoically, dressed in such a calming colour (doubtless carefully selected) was profoundly reassuring, even to those who profess to be monarchy sceptics. All this talk of duty sounds rather serious and possibly a little joyless, but the Queen evidently derives plenty of enjoyment from what she wears. And the fact that she came of age during an era when not looking one's best, whatever the occasion, was considered a discourtesy to others, as well as a betrayal of one's own potential (look at the way Captain Tom puts on a suit and his medals every day to complete his garden laps) releases her of the modern obligation younger royals now have to dress from the high street every so often.

The young Princess Elizabeth started out as well dressed, then dabbled briefly in being fashionable. A felt square-dancing skirt she wore in the 1950s on an official visit to Canada became a bona-fide trendsetter and the yellow toque she wore in 1948 or the Dior inspired sack-coat she donned in 1960 seem straight from a glossy magazine.

In the early '60s there's even a nod or two towards Jackie Kennedy, then the world's most glamorous figure. The older the Queen gets, the more her clothes become her. This isn't only because the British have a weakness for venerable old women, especially if they're upper class. If her clothes sometimes made her look staid in her younger years, particularly in comparison with her fashion-loving sister, Margaret, by her 60s the Queen had grown into the uniform she had cultivated, becoming a regular feature on designers' inspiration boards. Everyone from Jean Paul Gaultier to Azzedine Alaïa adored her distinctive matching dresses and coats and often playful millinery. Now on the cusp of her 94th birthday, she's a bona-fide style icon – a term so overused as to be almost meaningless, except when in conjunction with her.

41,/lifestyle/beauty/what-to-do-about-quarantine-hair-20200409-p54ifg.html,What to do about 'quarantine' hair,"Wrangling unwanted hair may seem a trivial pursuit in our current situation. But as we come to grips with life in lockdown, it's worth doing whatever makes us feel good. If that means taking a stab at a new fringe, hair stylist Anthony Nader, founder of Raw hair salon in Sydney’s Surry Hills has some advice: it's just hair. “Salon owners like myself will always be here after your experimenting stage.” Whether you plan on letting nature take its course during quarantine, or are more inclined to DIY, three experts reveal the dos and don'ts of personal grooming at home.   If you have grey hair or dark roots showing, Anthony Nader says opt for a coloured root spray, and comb it through. DIY dyeing is fine, says Nader, but do not attempt anything more serious than a semi-permanent hair colour. And if you’re blonde? “Hand on heart, doing your own roots is so risky – it never ends well.” Nader says you’re better off freshening up your blonde strands and any brassiness by using a mauve coloured shampoo and conditioner.   Men, says Nader, should feel free to embrace longer locks (including that beard you’ve always wanted) but this is no excuse to let it all slide. ""Manscaping is a must. Aim to trim your beard at least once a fortnight."" There is no need to use a beard shampoo, he says. Simply wash your face and ensure you have good lighting.   According to Hannah Mutze, National Brow Artist at Benefit Cosmetics Australia, only two things are required to grow out your eyebrows: patience and time. “The process is unique to every person and can take anywhere from four weeks to 12 months or more"". Still, says Mutze, ""every hair counts.” Mutze recommends tweezing, but only a little. ""Place your pinky finger over your brow ensuring the bulk of it is completely covered, then only remove the hairs that sit higher or lower than your finger. Try tracing a horizontal line on either side of your finger with a brow pencil to make it easier."" “Brush your brows daily,” says Mutze. “This stimulates the skin around them, encouraging blood flow to the area which can lead to more growth.” While you wait, fake a fuller looking brow with a fibrous brow gel like Gimme Brow Plus. “The micro-fibres within the formula adhere to your brows making them look instantly thicker, fuller and more defined.”   Fancy phasing out shampoo? It’s known as the “No Poo” movement and its proponents claim to have been liberated from the soapy shackles of shampoo and the cycle of oil-stripping, preferring instead to use bicarb of soda, apple cider vinegar or nothing at all. The result, they claim, is bouncier, shinier, healthier hair – though it is a process that can take between two and six weeks. In the meantime, you have to contend with, well, a lot of oil. Diana D’Amore, brand manager at Original & Mineral haircare says that if you want to stop the cycle of overly dry hair or an oily scalp, a “clean” shampoo that’s free of sulphates and parabens is the way forward. The difference is that clean shampoos don’t foam up, which means your hair is no longer being stripped of oils. “You may need to shampoo twice to begin with until your hair gets used to a sulphate-free shampoo,” says D’Amore. “Try a gentle deep cleansing shampoo like O&M Original Detox shampoo.” Replay     If your favourite waxer is also in lockdown, you’re left with a choice. Do you want to find out what six months’ worth of body hair looks like? If the answer is yes, then as you were. If the answer is anything else, you can try DIY waxing, but be warned, you’re not going to get exactly the same results. That’s because salons use hard wax, which is less painful. If you must wax, experts recommend prepping with baby powder, and using only small strips. And whatever you do, don’t overheat it.
